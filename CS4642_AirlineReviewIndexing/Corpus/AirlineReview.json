Qantas is always my first choice or South African Airlines as partner. Would be nice to one day get an upgrade but that is fine. Qantas flight to Cape Town, the food was shocking boiled packet style food as per an old age home. No fruit and little water. Alcohol was easily available. Qantas flight to Australia the air stewards were obnoxious, Danny advising he is not an octopusssssss with many hands and can only do one thing at a time. Please do not hold onto his shirt tails when an elderly lady tapped him whilst he was working the trolley. He then spent the last half hour explaining they were understaffed and had 7 medical emergencies on the plane. Several people commented how rude the staff are. I requested some fruit from Danny, 5 hours into the flight. There is no fruit, he had only the one last apple to offer me. I asked for a banana \u2013 that is it there is no fruit !!! The stewardess advised I should wait till breakfast for the fruit platter. At breakfast Danny advised there was no fruit platter available he will get me vegetarian from 1st class. Whilst clearing service he brought over an opened cold beans and something which I declined. The service is somewhat of a canteen I would rather fly South African Airways with staff who are polite and hopefully the food is prepared in South Africa."]},

Although he asked several times, no one could direct him to the American Airlines ticket counter and there are no signs for American Airlines posted anywhere. At first he thought he was in the wrong airport but could see his flight posted on the monitor. He had checked in using the mobile app the day before but was told he had to get boarding passes at the counter. He tried again to use the mobile app and it wouldn\u2019t allow him. He tried to call American\u2019s international help number and there was no answer. We looked online to see if there were directions to their ticket counters and it said they used numbers 90 to 95 so we directed him there and no one was there. He called me panicked about what to do. We were able to get through to American here. At that time I was told that American only has one flight a day from Lisbon back to the States and that American does not have a permanent ticketing counter at the Lisbon Airport and that about one hour before the flight leaves, the one employee who works the ticket counter then leaves the ticket counter to go and board the passengers on the plane. So if you get caught in traffic and get there with an hour to spare, you are still too late. They changed his ticket but I had to pay $400 in change fees. They could not tell me what time a person would appear at the ticket counter but advised that my son should be there at least two hours in advance of the flight. I was also told that their ticket counters were located now at counters 40 through 46 so website was not accurate. The woman I spoke with to change the ticket was unsympathetic and unhelpful. We were told we couldn\u2019t speak to a live person about the problems that we had and were told that we had to write an email. We got a stock response back giving us a number to call and telling us they would get back with us soon. My husband did call the number and the woman gave him a number for airport operations in Lisbon but said she had never been to Lisbon so had no idea what airport looked like. American is like an abusive friend that I keep giving second chances and who keeps messing up. I have had so many issues with them in the past and now this. I do not recommend American Airlines to anyone. Their employees are unhelpful and sullen and do not seem to know anything. They won\u2019t take responsibility for their own mistakes like in this case where they failed to mention in advance that there are no American Airlines signs to direct you in the airport. Avoid them at all costs even if you have to pay a little more, at least you will be assured that you are not going to have your flight canceled and that there\u2019s going to be enough people working to actually run the airlines. American used to be an excellent airlines with great service. The fact that they are now competing with the really low discount airlines with regard to service is just sad. If you are flying out of Portugal with them though and you can\u2019t change your ticket, make sure that you call a day in advance to check on where the ticketing desk is going to be since it appears to change and know that there are no signs."]},

We were leaving Friday evening and planning on returning on Sunday. We were five minutes out from the airport when we received a text letting us know that the flight was canceled. Not because of bad weather but because of maintenance. After a terrible call to your help line where they were rude and informed me they could not do anything for me, I went to get in line at the airport kiosk to speak to someone in person since I was already there and had already spent $75 on my Uber to get there. That is when I discover the true dysfunction. They had no idea what was going on, and the line to speak to anyone took an hour and a half. They had people that were supposed to be working just standing around chatting with each other with a huge line waiting. Each person that came up to the kiosk took around a half hour to get moving. Ive never seen more frustrated people in one place. Not just because of the flight to Charlotte, but because of a number of different flights. The girl next to me was literally in tears because they had lost her reservation back to Greece (which they eventually made right after acting like there was nothing they could do). The person behind me going to Vegas was denied a boarding pass to Vegas because he showed up 59 minutes before to get his boarding pass. One man was sitting down on the kiosk on the phone himself for over an hour trying to get rescheduled himself after you employees gave him the phone because they couldnt handle the probelm, he felt so bad that he went around and apologized to everyone after and certainly was criticizing American Airlines. By the time I finally got to the front of the line, the woman I was dealing with told me she couldn\u2019t get me on another flight that day and couldn\u2019t refund my ticket. I had to go online. Its absurd they don\u2019t give their employees the ability to help customers in real time. I don\u2019t know what CRM they use, but everyone of their employees acts helpless and useless. I called customer service again while at the airport and they said they couldn\u2019t refund me and also pointed me towards the website I finally had to take an Uber back at my own expense again, I didn\u2019t receive a refund for my ticket, I didn\u2019t get reschedule on a flight same night so I had to cancel my trip all together. When I finally get home and try to get a refund on my ticket your site tells me I am not eligible. The fact that I had to call the help line again was absurd. Finally they issued the refund over the phone. Why their customer service rep at the airport couldn\u2019t do that I don\u2019t know. The refund finally came back and obviously didn\u2019t include taxes and your processing fees so I am out another $100 approximately. So when all is said and done they canceled my trip for no reason and could not reschedule me. I am out hundreds of dollars in out of pocket expenses. They wasted hours of my time. And I was not offered any reimbursement or compensation of any type even though I requested it."]},

Everything looked fine until I reached Dubai Airport (DXB) before gate. My luggage was weighed by Emirates staff (One cabin bag and a laptop bag) and I was passed through. At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn\u2019t carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn\u2019t check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her immediately Mr. Mohamed (Seemed their Supervisor) came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and started taking to the other side, saying \u201d let me see now, get him deported\u201d. took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said no it is heavier. I opened the bag and showed that there was nothing in the bag except the laptop. but he was acting really rude and was ignoring what I was showing him on ticket documents. he said your other bag is also heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that.I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It was just that he was trying to harass me. He was being extremely rude and said he will make sure that my flight is missed. I was really in trauma while dealing with him as it seemed that he was trying that my flight is missed. As I was in a different country I was really afraid. He was not allowing me to go. It looked like that other emirates staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior. One of the staff member who had weighed my luggage earlier and allowed slowly told me that I could complain online about him. I tried to ask his name but I was told that they couldn\u2019t tell his name. which later I saw on him uniform that his name was Mohammed. Finally I requested him to let me go and I will pay the amount whatever additional they charge. I felt it like a ransom. After a lot of request and paying the amount he allowed me and told the staff to still check in my luggage and didn\u2019t allow in the flight. I was really depressed after this incident and I was scared about my return flight if somehow this person is there again he may put me in trouble again. He shouldn\u2019t have behaved like this. I was surprised why these kind of criminal mentality people are serving in such a service field. I will never take Emirates in future for me and my family, I have also told my friends about this incident and have suggested to not to use Emirates for flights touching Dubai."]},

On my last flight, I reached the check in desk in the queue one hour and 20 minutes before my flight, but they turned me away saying I was too late. This was despite the fact that they had already weighed my luggage and processed the passengers in front of me and subsequently the passengers behind me. The problem seemed to be that I had a voucher for extra baggage after trading in my Airmiles which the check in staff were not happy about. I had to purchase a new ticket for the following day at great expense and inconvenience. I contacted the customer complaints department in their office who were not interested in this issue or a refund. They falsely claimed that the reason I was denied boarding was due to a heavy suitcase (I transferred some items to another case) and late. However they could not explain if this was the case, why did they weigh my luggage and process others in the queue? I strongly recommend that you do not use Sri Lankan Airlines!!!"]},

As there are more passengers inside the cabin compared to other airlines, the number of flight attendee is not enough to for providing satisfactory care.

We made a complaint immediately to Sri Lankan and it took them 3 weeks to reply \u2013 of course they couldn\u2019t offer anything other than a weak response. Terrible customer service, terrible airline \u2013 Avoid at all costs as there are much better options to get to Sri Lanka."]},

First the flight attendants on United and their partner Lufthansa are neither friendly nor sympathetic. They act like you are getting in the way of them doing their job. One flight attendant was wearing a toxic amount of cologne. In a closed space like a plane for 8 hours could cause someone with asthma could be life-threatening. This is just inconsiderate. If passengers are tasting her perfume every time she walks by, it\u2019s too much! Second, why doesn\u2019t United know how to accommodate people with special dietary needs like allergies? I\u2019m allergic to dairy but if I order the non- lactose meal I don\u2019t get ant meat. Or worse I get tofu (also cannot eat). This flight I tried another meal-muslim. This time no meat again, but I did get yogurt and butter which I could not eat. All Muslims are not vegetarians. I think United\u2019s solution to customers with food issues is to give everyone a vegetarian meal. I really miss Delta which is an airline that actually serves non- dairy products with the meat and veggies in their non- dairy meal. Unfortunately the US government gave United the European route this year so we are forced to suffer with this inconsiderate and ignorant company."]},

My flight was supposed to be at 6:55 am from Durham to Des Moines. I planned it this way because I had a job interview at 12:10 pm in Des Moines. They cancelled my flight because it was delayed, they cancelled it instead of just putting me into the delayed flight. So I was put into a flight that left the same day at 2:55 from Durham to Houston and then to Des Moines. Of course, I would miss my job interview. The person who I spoke to did not show any concern and made it obvious that they did not care about the mistake they made. Once at the airport, the flight was delayed which meant that I would arrive at Houston at 6:45 which meant that I would miss the flight from Houston to Des Moines. So they again changed my flight to a later one which put me in Des Moines at 9:00 pm. Again, the operator did not give a rats ass about my situation. This was the first time that I flew and the experience was a horrible one. I will never again fly with this airline because they make their passengers feel like they are unimportant and that our concerns are not important. It is irresponsible in their part to change a passengers flight 3 different times. My whole day was wasted at the airport. I flew from Des Moines to Durham through Delta; I had no problems at all with Delta. When I called the operators for Delta, they were extremely nice and showed that they cared about the passenger unlike United Airline. Why would United Airline cancel my first flight? Was it because someone else paid more for my seat that I had already paid for in advanced? It is absolutely absurd that my flight was changed 3 different times and that each time the operator was a complete jerk. For anyone reading this, I would much rather pay a little more to take Delta than to be treated like dirt and have your flight cancelled multiple times. I also noticed that Delta gave up to 900 dollars to people who volunteered to take another flight or to wait for a different flight when they were overbooked. United Airline just takes you off the flight and basically makes the passenger feel like they are shit out of luck."]},

Despite my comment above, my LAX-LAS flight was 30mins delayed but they kept everyone at the gate well informed. Looking at a few recent reviews\u2026I have to laugh at people complaining about Basic Economy and what you do/don\u2019t get. I\u2019ve looked at this fare and the restrictions are very clear when you go through the booking process. Don\u2019t buy it if it doesn\u2019t suit your needs. Likewise, complaints about delays. It\u2019s an airline! Delays and cancellations happen sometimes!! I guess most people that complain about a delay/cancellation are people that don\u2019t travel frequently, are inconvenienced on their one trip a year, and just don\u2019t get it. I do get their frustration though. It\u2019s just unlucky. No point hating on airline for a delay though."]},

I booked a one way flight through Priceline for my mom who was coming on 01/01/18 to help with my surgery the next day. It was initially booked for 10:19-11:55 from PVD to IAD. It got delayed and we were notified it will be a couple of hours late. We then decided to wait there at the airport. Bum, the next email said 3 hours now was the delay. We were with our young son who got really bored from waiting 4 hours at the airport (mind you IAD is 1 hour away from where we live). When they said they would take off at 3:30 we then decided to go back home and just wait. In the meantime they had told their passenger they are trying to fix the battery first, then they were trying to fix something else that they had just ordered express. The next thing we heard was my mom telling us the flight god cancelled! That was the biggest shame. They then tried to book another flight for her that would leave providence RI to go to Newark and from there to Baltimore. She had worked overrnight on 12/31 and spent 12 hours at the airport. She got home so tired and she was even unable to help out with my surgery which was the reason why she was coming!!! Beware. I was just so sad and hurt to deal with such unreliable airline. Thank you! I will not book with you again\u2026.."]},

You will definitely be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads, and they have those monsters in their back office! what even make it worst, is that I am a regular customer since 2008 & I am on their skyward mileage reward, with a very good/strong history but still wasn\u2019t enough, and they unleashed those complaint team monsters on me \ud83d\ude42 To cut the story short, I bought a ticket with a stopover in dubai, and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more, so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesn\u2019t allow me to stay 1 more day (Max 7 days), and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket! which is nonsense! so I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me! so thats what I call \u201cPirates\u201d attitude, imagine how many people could just pay that penalty without checking or asking for a 1 way ticket! So I submitted a complaint, and simply asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn\u2019t make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there\u2019s no way out! and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! so They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back. (The funny thing, that when you see their ads and the way they sell their services doesn\u2019t reflect any reality, so don\u2019t believe those ads you see, as it doesn\u2019t reflects the whole picture, there is a hidden dark side) So to summarize the story, don\u2019t feel smart when you find a very attractive ticket by emirates as you might end up paying more to go home, plus you will have some disturbing moments when you try to solve this issue with them. Anyway, I only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me, and if you have the time to read the T&C then please do. otherwise you will get bullied by their pirates (complaint department)."]},

(This is an extra cost over regular coach because you get extra leg room and other benefits). Being claustrophobic, I needed the seats that we originally chose. AA changed the plane that they were going to fly to Australia (a 15.5 hour flight from LA) and took it upon themselves to move us to MUCH worse seats in the regular coach section. My husband is a Platinum flier for life with 3 million miles flown on AA. After speaking to several supervisors at the platinum desk and writing to customer service, I AA refused to do anything about it. At the very least, they should have refunded the $1300 that we had to pay to purchase extra miles in order to get the upgraded section! SHAME ON YOU American Airlines. It\u2019s no wonder that you no longer carry elite status in the airline industry if this is how you treat your customers who have been loyal to you for many years!

We were then contacted for the next two days with constantly changing information about our rebooking. American Airlines also miscommunicated to the hotel the value of our food vouchers; we were told a particular value in the airport, and the hotel was only told half the amount. TWO DAYS after our scheduled departure, we were rebooked, loaded back in a bus to the airport, and upon parking and unloading, informed that our flight had been cancelled AGAIN; we were sent back to the hotel. Finally, three days later we were put into a flight with a different airline and were able to get back to the US. I missed two days of work and had to buy a completely new ticket for a connecting flight through a different airline in the US because of the delay, and they offered a measly voucher worth less than half the cost of the original flight. I wrote a complaint email, detailed with pictures and information, and American Airlines refused to budge. I\u2019m extremely displeased.

In the past, if you\u2019d book a coach seat, you would have a carry-on and a check-in bag included, and if you had an extra bag, it was still ok, no extra fee. You would get a free meal, and the entertainment, although it was on the minimalist side (because technology was not what it is today), was properly working (at least, most of the time). Not anymore. Today, well, where do I start? You book a basic economy seat for a price that is proportionally the same as for an economy flight in the past, AND you have to pay for virtually every single thing on top of that. Only one small item allowed with you on the plane (I guess United figured that you might need a pair of extra underwear and socks if you go to the other side of the country) and they will give you a hard time if you bring a second one (like your camera bag, for instance). Which means that, if you bring a small item with you, along with a luggage of carry-on size, they will ask you to check that luggage in and you will have to pay a $25 fee. If you have an actual check-in luggage on top, that will be considered second check-in luggage, an extra $35. If you book a round trip, that\u2019s already an extra $120 on top of your ticket price. Now, note that I am traveling alone. Imagine being in that situation with a family\u2026 Once you are on the plane, no meal other than the usual boring pretzels and a glass of cheap soda or juice. Prices for extra food/drinks are, of course, comfortably marked-up (food and drinks that are of questionable quality). I\u2019m not even mentioning the ever missing extra blankets despite the still totally dysfunctional temperature management on the plane. Now, moving onto the entertainment part: extraordinarily, United has managed to make YOU, the ticket payer, use your own electronic devices and ear sets, so they can save thousands of dollars by not having to build-in an entertainment system for your plane section. How amazingly smart is that? Instead, they royally connect you to their internal server (of course, if you want real internet, it\u2019s extra. And not cheap) and allow you to download a ridiculously impractical software plug-in that, if you ever finally manage to download and use it, turns out to be the worst piece of garbage I\u2019ve ever used on a plane to watch a movie. I eventually had to stop the experience. You simply can\u2019t deal with a movie that is so chopped up by the constant disconnections from the server that it becomes literally\u2026 unwatchable. By the way, absolutely zero electric or USB plug anywhere around your seat to recharge your devices. Only in selective rows. So, what comes next, United? Paying to use the toilets on the plane? Charging a fee to bring our own device? Another fee to have a reclining seat? Where does it end? How much money can you still manage to save on the back of the customer? Lately, almost every single time I took a United flight, I felt you guys were simply trying to squeeze every dollar out of the customer. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the plane. Yes, you can always say other companies pull their own tricks on customers, that you have expenses, that the market is bad, etc\u2026 I travel all over the world, and many companies that belong to so-called \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d are better than you and treat their customers better than you do. As far as I\u2019m concerned, From now on, I am going to make sure of one thing: to only put my feet on your planes if I have absolutely no other choice."]},

The new Basic Economy fair offered by United appears to be a marketing trick to make their lowest fair seem competitive with other airlines\u2019 basic fares. They are not when you consider the grab for further dollars one experiences at the airport kiosk by attendants stationed there for no other reason than to hold one\u2019s boarding pass hostage until they can very strictly put one through a bag measurement process almost certainly designed to fail most bags. When I made my airline selection for this trip, I had three acceptable airline choices for what seemed to be comparable economy fares, with similar measurement maximums for one\u2019s allowable personal item. I selected United for no other reason than their fare and bag seemed to match the others, but I liked the flight time slightly better. I could have just as easily chosen either of the other two airlines. Had I known the ugliness and embarrassment they would cause me in front of my daughter due to their extortion of further funds at the kiosk, I would certainly have chosen one of the other two. United seems to continually hate and disrespect their customers with policies and procedures designed to humiliate them for needing to fly on a budget due either to family or other commitments. When I left home, I carefully measured both my and my 11 year old daughter\u2019s personal items. Aside from the wheels on her very small child\u2019s size suitcase, both items fit the measurements. I put my purse inside my personal item, such that between the two of us we had exactly two items. The Basic Economy fare does not allow one to check in online before arriving at the airport. One is forced to print one\u2019s boarding pass at the airport kiosk. When one arrives at the kiosk, one cannot complete the boarding pass process without having an attendant approve final printing of the pass by checking the size of the personal item, then scanning his/her badge to unlock the system. The attendant had no problem with our personal items when we left our home airport. We arrived at our destination without incident. United immediately sent me an option to review my leaving flight, but I wanted to wait until we returned home. Returning home from Dallas international airport a few days later was a completely different story. I had to get up in the middle of the night to return our rental car and make a 6am flight. When we arrived at the kiosk, the attendant put us through a rigorous bag measuring process. A zipper on my personal item kept catching on the metal, thus causing a bit of struggle, but I was able to get the bag into the box easily once it loosened. I was VERY tired from having gotten up in the middle of the night, and forgot to put my purse into my personal item. I had to struggle to stuff it in at the last minute. My daughter\u2019s very small suitcase fit exactly, except for the small wheels. Her small suitcase fit under the seat if front with plenty of room to spare on the way to Dallas. Regardless of this fact, the kiosk attendant stated that the measurement requirements had nothing to do with whether or not the item fit under the seat, meaning they were in place solely as a justification to get more money for baggage fees. Once I paid for the bag, the attendant didn\u2019t even finish printing our boarding passes. I had to go back to the kiosk after checking the tiny suitcase to get another attendant to finish printing our passes. The attendants are stationed at the kiosks for no other purpose than to collect more money by scrupulously measuring bags. They are not there for any benefit to the customer whatsoever and could care less about the humiliating them to get more money. Feeling intense despise for United."]},

We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite. The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stoney faces \u2013 no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience. Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains haven\u2019t come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband \u2013 are they not taught how to serve customers? We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final \u201cthank you for flying Emirates\u201d sounded matter of fact and so insincere. On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customers\u2019 comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers. Next time we fly to Australia we will use Singapore airlines again \u2013 far superior."]},

We solved the problem by booking a flight Alice Springs-Darwin by Virgin Australia. 2. I don\u2019t think anybody of the Management has ever travelled in economy class. The food is simply bad. On our flight Dubai-Melbourne we got as breakfast (after a flight of 11 hours) a small box containing cereals and some milk. Bread ??? Eggs ??? Fruit ?? On the similar flight Adelaide \u2013Dubai, but operated by Emirates, we even got a choice of eggs, we got fruit, we got bread \u2026. On the flight Darwin-Adelaide we got as lunch a small box containing some Asian food. Nothing else \u2026.. Honestly, the smallest roadside shop sells 10 times better food than this. It was simply disgusting \u2026\u2026 Drinks have to be paid for !! On the flight by Virgin Australia we got a decent lunch and free drinks. 3. E-mail messages are simply not replied to, maybe somewhere next year \u2013 who knows. All this makes me sure to nominate QANTAS as the worst airline of the year\u2026.."]},

While at the airport we learn or flight back to our home destination was cancelled. American Airlines thru text, offered us a flight the next morning at 9am. So that sounds like sleep at the airport and leave tomorrow at 9am. No. We didnt want to do that. Go to AA customer service. Waited 2hrs in the line to even speak with someone but once we had this is what they did. Offered us 2 flights 1 standby flight at 4:30pm and a guarantee flight at 6pm. Neither flight going to our home destination which means once we get there we would need to rent a car to drive home. So. Mean while while one person was tending that situation I go to locate our luggage. Now this is the BIG MMM HM! So in the meantime before we got the stand by flights we were debating to immediate rent a car and drive home from the airport so lets locate our bags. Bags are NO WHERE to be found. AA said we could track our bags thru the website. The entire 7hrs we\u2019re at the airport our bags are sitting at the airport we are at. SO said all this to say. WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL FOR PASSENGERS WHO FLIGHTS GET CANCELLED!! Its a very BAD idea to fly their bags to the next destination! And why if the passengers are waiting for a flight that is not leaving until 7hrs later, the AA should have made it there BUSINESS to find our luggage and made sure it was loaded onto the flight they picked for us! Instead of totally giving us the run around about our luggage. Long story short, we did get home around 10:45pm from a flight that should have gotten us home at 2pm. I will NEVER fly AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN. Its a Wrap!! Oh I forgot to mention $60 to check 2 bags $100 for a bag 1lb overweight but we can lose your bags and no two people that work for the same airline can give you the same info about your luggage. Customer Service SUCKS! Not saying that the people we nasty while speaking with us but when you switch plans at the last minute i.e. canceling a flight. Airlines you should be on it! How can we help? What can we do to assist you and we\u2019ll take care of it? Because you all have inconvenienced me. I was disgusted, hurt, heart broken, and I am still. I am just praying to the good Lord above PLEASE RETURN MY BAGS WITH ALL MY BELONGINGS! Please come up with a better service for passengers flights get cancelled."]},

I have since read so many bad reviews that I wished I had read before making the booking. It was a special trip for my daughters birthday to NYC to see her sister.

Is this not a security violation? On one hand, you are enforcing \u201crules\u201d at the middle of my journey and at the same time, you are giving me ideas on how to break them?

I was then downgraded to regular class on an earlier flight with no option of getting refunded. I asked the woman on the phone to double check there was no first class seats available on the 6 am flight.

The ultimate betrayal was the flight home, I booked both my wife and I ticket simultaneously yet they sat us nowhere near each other, and the reason because obvious when my wife was seated next to a morbidly obese passenger and so was I. It seems that being a normal size is a disadvantage with qantas, if you need one and a half seats, then they can just find a couple who are not obese and ruin their flight.

For someone with lactose intolerance this was not acceptable. This happened both on Dallas to Sydney and the Sydney to Cairns and Cairns to Melbourne flights. Now on our return flight from Melbourne to LAX I checked our seats this morning and we had a window and a middle. I tend to sleep a lot on flights so window seats work best for the comfort of other passengers who may like to get up a lot. When we got to the airport we got our boarding passes and they moved us to an aisle and middle. We are together but not happy. We would rather sit apart if that meant we had a window seat. I was then told to guarantee my seat I had to have paid an extra $25 per person. What is the point of this?!? Why don\u2019t they just tack this in to the already exorbitant fare?

After about 20 minutes on  plane they tell us to get off, go back to terminal, and lug all our bags back with us.  herded BACK outside were we stood waiting for the bus to show up, crowded back into a small hot bus and back up into the terminal.  The ramps were steep and I\u2019m sure very hard for the elderly couple and seeing impaired passagengers. Told we had to get off cuz,we were on plane 45 mins.

The Qantas inflight entertainment  was only marginally better but the one thing which did stand out was that the Qantas crew did, in my eyes at least, seem better trained and a lot more professional. The Emirates Boeing  777 was only a few months old and had much larger screens then the Qantas A380. Seat comfort was about the same."]},

If you went to another airport there may not have been enough spare crew therefore your flight would be delayed by more than what it was due to mandatory rest periods. Any delay due to weather means the airline is not liable to do anything for the passenger unless they choose to. This is the case with all airlines and unfortunately you would probably have found the same inconvenience and out  of pocket expenses with all the airlines in the US. We know this doesn\u2019t change the fact that you lost precious holiday time which is beyond frustrating but hopefully it helps answer why things happened the way they did."]},

Our flight to Dong Hoi got delayed by approximately 45 minutes, and the service of the staff was not friendly. These delays are routine, this is not uncommon for VietJet. Each of the three airlines; Vietnam, Vietjet, and Jetstar Pacific have one flight back to HCMC each day. It was quite rainy the day we flew back, but the Vietnam Airlines and Jetstar flights managed to take off in the morning. The Vietjet flight however, was delayed 2 hours due to the same weather conditions that the Vietnam Airlines flight took off in an hour before. They managed to bring up bottled water for all passengers do compensate for the delay, but the cabin crew as per usual weren\u2019t friendly once we were aboard and the food options were extremely limited. If flying in/out of Vietnam or domestically, I would highly recommend flying Vietnam Airlines or Jetstar. Vietjet is just plain terrible."]},

We got an email 2 times a few days before departure to tell us about the changes so make sure you check your email regularly for updates. They are very strict with carry on weight so make sure you are only bringing a carry on for 7KG total for 2 items. They will add everything together at the aiport. We ended paying around $35 CAD in fine as my carry one suitcase and back pack was over 7KG total. You can only have 1 check in suitcase per person at 40-50lbs max so make sure to pack light and not too much. The seats were not that comfy as the cushion thin so best to only use VietJet for short flights within Vietnam. I would avoid booking them for long flights unless you don\u2019t mind seats with thin cushions. Overall they are good value for what you are paying. I would use them again if they are the cheapest & for short domestic flights only."]},

Also, as there is quite a large headrest attached to the seat, so when you aren\u2019t reclined at all, you actually feel that you are tilting slightly forward. This also means that when you recline your seat as far as you can go, you are barely reclining at all. I can usually sleep on a plane (travelled Melbourne to LA and back in this instance), but I found it impossible to do so on this trip because of the seats. Every time I dropped off my head would fall forward and I would wake myself up. Also, the side bits on the headrest (not sure what they are called???) did not move in enough to support me in the slightest or stop my head from falling forward when I fell asleep. I know passengers get annoyed about people reclining back in the seat in front of them, but this is taking things too far! Also, every time there was any turbulence (and it was all extremely minor), a recorded message came blaring over the intercom. It was five times louder than it needed to be and kept waking everyone up!"]},

Usually when he flies from Las Vegas via Los Angeles to Melbourne Australia he always flies with Virgin/Delta. On one occasion he couldn\u2019t get a flight out with them and flew Qantas A380. He was so impressed with the take off and landing, how spacious the seat was and how good the food was that I too wanted to fly out in it. We usually fly with EVA air and Korean Airlines and have found them to be amazing. This time round we  and our 6 weeks old child flew with Qantas. I called and made sure i got a bassinet as I didn\u2019t want to have hold my child for 13++ hours. Since i made the bookings directly with Qantas their partner airline was American Airline, I called the airlines and made sure i was assigned a seat and they said the bassinets are based on first come first serve basis. I explained that i was flying out of Las Vegas and they wouldn\u2019t be at Los Angeles early enough to be assigned that, so they assigned me a bassinet. When we got to the airport, our connecting flight was delayed and the staff only printed one ticket of our international leg. Once we got to the gate, we asked the staff there if they could print out the second ticket. They were happy to but after trying they said, \u201cyou\u2019re definitely booked but i just can\u2019t print the ticket\u201d We would have to wait to get our second ticket once we arrived in LA. The whole time we had seats 52G,H (flying from LA to MEL) assigned to us as we had a newborn and that was the bulkhead. When we got to LA, the staff printed our ticket, whilst running to the bus I realized she had changed our seat to seat 49. Upon arrival at the check in gate I asked is seat 49 a bulkhead seat and the staff said no. The i explained i had called and booked to have the bulkhead and it was confirmed when i checked in at home. After 35 minutes of typing away at the computer, the staff finally said, I\u2019m sorry your flight was delayed so we cancelled your seat. How can they do that???? She continued to say, there was another family with a child that needed it so we gave it to them. You can\u2019t argue with that. I said fine. I still don\u2019t understand how you can cancel someones seat when you know we have already checked in. I requested for a seat with a bassinet and i really didn\u2019t care which part of the plane it was. By this time i was getting upset but still keeping my cool. Upon entering the plane my husband and I glanced to see who was sitting in our seats \u2026 guess what!! there was no family with a child but two elderly couple. Isn\u2019t the bulkhead a priority for parents with infants? We looked at the whole row, the bulkhead on the far right is 3 seater row with 2 people sitting in it with no infant and the one on the left side had the same no infant. the only family with infant was on row 52E,F. 3 bassinets wasted.", "Anyway we are now sitting at the back of the plane, the seats are tight not at all spacious. We explained our distress to the head steward and he was really nice and so was the crew on that flight. He even gave us a fast pass to get out of customs quickly. We were grateful for that, but in the end it didn\u2019t make a difference if we got through customs quickly or slowly as 3 of our 5 bags didn\u2019t make the flight. Im just happy the bag with my child\u2019s formula made it but totally disappointed with the whole flight. Since our child\u2019s capsule didn\u2019t make the flight Qantas was gracious enough to lend us one. Since they didn\u2019t have one at the airport we needed to wait for one to be sent to the airport. That took another 2 hours.

Disappointingly to a Qantas shareholder and Platinum Frequent Flyer, this trip confirmed that Qantas is falling further behind in its competition with other airlines. The short Sydney to Auckland leg was on an Emirates codeshare A380. The Business Class seating and service on this flight was luxurious in comparison with the Qantas flights.  In particular, for the long flight (4hrs 35mins) from Sydney to Perth, Qantas used a recycled Jetstar A330.  There was no in-seat entertainment system.  It was only after discussing it with a steward more than an hour into the flight that we discovered we should have been provided with tiny I-pads for entertainment. These were not in our seat pockets and there was no information advising passengers that they were available. The steward located a couple for us.  While the I-pads provided some entertainment options, they were not very good because of the poor quality earphones provided. I struggled to hear even at full volume on the I-pad. In addition, the controls for seat comfort in the plane did not work. We had to get the steward to manually pull on the leg rest and foot extension to make the seat more comfortable. Apparently this was a common problem on this plane. Considering we paid full Business Class fares, we expected better than this.  As usual, the Qantas stewards go out of their way to improve the flying experience however their efforts are wasted if Qantas management provide a poor quality on-board environment for passengers.  Our recent experience left us feeling \u2018ripped off\u2019 by Qantas. We paid a lot of money for our flights but did not get the quality expected or provdied by other airlines.  Qantas needs to improve quickly if it is to remain a valued and profitable airline particulalrly on the services it provdies to West Australians who feel they are being treated as Cinderella by Qantas.

I resent being lied to by staff and then ignored by customer services when I submitted a complaint. The final straw was when I travelled business class with a long layover, booked on line and told to get my hotel voucher in Dubai. Arrived at midnight with 9 hours before my connection and was told that I was not eligible for a hotel.  I was given several highly unlikely reasons why I was not eligible for the hotel which the Emirates website had told me I was eligible for, including that I should flown at a different time of day to avoid the need for a hotel.  I sat in the lounge for 9 hours and when I complained to customer services they denied that I was given any of the excuses that I was given at the time (I had taken the names of the people I had spoken to) and invented some more equally unlikely \u201creasons.\u201d  Emirates customer services never admits any mistake by Emirates.     If you travel on Emirates it will be a pleasant experience if all goes according to plan but don\u2019t expect any receptiveness to your situation, an apology much less anything to rectify the issue."]},

I had never had a problem with sickness associated with flying before but I was very ill the entire way home on this occasion, and I was blown away by the outstanding service of Qantas staff to make sure I was okay and comfortable. As soon as I got on the flight I asked for extra sick bags, and from that moment onwards I felt as though I had my own private team of nurses looking after me. The cabin crew working my particular cabin would keep checking up on me and ask me if there was anything they could do to help, and shortly after take-off they set me up a little bed at the back of the plane where there were a few spare seats together. The stewardess brought me a ginger beer as she said it was great for nausea and it definitely was. I can\u2019t thank Qantas enough for helping me out on what was a very startling and uncomfortable situation for me, and have since this time been very impressed by their domestic services as well.

I fly frequently enough to have reached the Gold level of their horrific frequent flyer scheme, but more on that later.", "Firstly, let\u2019s look at Value For Money.  Emirates are consistently more expensive than their full service competitors, even in the face of falling oil costs. By contrast, the quality of their service has been in steady decline for the last 4 years.  On my first flights between LGW and DXB in Economy on the Boeing 777 and 777-ER, staff were friendly and attentive, multiple drink services were made during each flight and attendant requests were followed up promptly.  On my first Business Class flight from LGW to DXB I was greeted by name with a glass of Champagne on boarding and looked after beautifully throughout the flight.  Compare to my experiences in the last twelve months: in economy the in flight drinks service on medium haul flight has been cut to once per flight (usually about half an hour after the meal has been served) and staff have become surly, impatient and inattentive. The same is true in Business Class, food service has become sloppy and erratic and drink requests frequently go ignored. On a flight from Cape Town to Dubai in June, my wife and I waited nearly two hours for our main courses to be served after we had received our starters. When the hostess eventually did re-appear to clear our starters, she asked if we were ready for dessert. On another flight I had the audacity to ask for a second glass of wine to accompany my (extremely dry) chicken biryani. I waited for 20 minutes before the hostess returned and confiscated my wine glass. I was not even offered a glass of water for the remainder of the flight and the biryani gave me food poisoning.", "Now, let\u2019s look at entertainment. The Emirates ICE (Information, Communication, Entertainment) system is generally pretty good, but is inconsistent across the fleet. In 2011 Emirates started to upgrade the ICE hardware in their 777s, but seem to have abandoned this program.  I don\u2019t know the exact figures but in the 28 flights I have taken since 2011, I have seen the new hardware 3 times. The equipment is unreliable with video and/or audio frequently failing, and in some cases not working at all. Twice while travelling in Business Class I have arrived at my seat to find the ICE system not working (things like this really ought to be checked pre-flight) and I have had to move to an inferior seat. On another occasion, travelling in Economy, my wife had to ask the Purser 5 times to have her ICE screen reset so that it would work properly. This brings me on the Customer Service\u2026", "The Emirates Customer Service scheme is deliberately designed to be as obtuse as possible. Complaints about poor in flight service can no longer be made on board direct to the Purser, instead you are told to send an email to ", "  If you do this, you will hear nothing for a month before finally receiving a reply telling you that issues with in flight service should be reported directly to the purses and that consequently your complaint has been closed. I have had cause to lodge several complaints with Emirates of the last 5 years, for a variety of reasons; poor in flight service, damaged/missing baggage, unexplained flight delays, poor check in procedures etc\u2026 And the outcome is always the same. After making a unilateral decision to close my complaint without my consent, the case is closed and all further correspondence is ignored.  On the one occasion that Emirates did acknowledge that they had done something wrong and offered me compensation, it was on the condition that I sign a document stating that they had not done anything wrong. Essentially,  this is Blackmail.", "Finally, the Skywards frequent scheme. Between us my wife and I have several hundred thousand Skywards miles. This is because whenever we try to spend the miles on Flights or Upgrades we are told that we can\u2019t. Most of the member benefits of Skywards Gold membership were withdrawn earlier this year and the dedicated checkin area for silver members at DXB is frequently left either understaffed and completely unmanned. So, a frequent flyer scheme that promises a lot, but delivers very little, regardless of membership tier.", "All in all, Emirates have stopped trying. When they were a fledgling airline striving for recognition in a global market place they went out of their way to excel. Now that they have achieved the recognition that they wanted, they have given up and are resting in their laurels. Very bad form!!!"]},

What kind of service is this? The attitude and manners of the crew was appalling! For a so-called state of the art airline that everyone keeps on talking positively about, this is not acceptable.

The seat entertainment was amazing with an extensive range of on-demand movies and games, as well as multiple cameras of the tail and undercarriage of the aircraft.

I am pleasant and thankful and this seems to go a long way towards making the experience the best \u2013 I really think it helps to make friends with the cabin staff here \u2013 they appreciate it and respond. Wine and food flows. The menu is very good. The cheese board is beautifully presented and amongst the best on all airlines.

These two window seats, at least, at the front of the second business class sub-cabin, seem to be semi-isolated by a forward projecting centre console between the seats, which houses the entertainment screen for seat 8I (or 8C). It means one has to enter the 8K  (or 8A) seat facing sideways but once in the space it is half way to a first class cell! Yes I liked it. One slight issue is the screen for 8K (or 8A) is on the partition in front of you, so a relatively long way away. I also could not find the control for adjusting the brightness on this screen so had to use the default setting and close the window shades to get best vision.", "\nAll in all though this seat and the flight aboard this magnificent 777 was thoroughly enjoyable. Would I rather be on an A380 \u2013 probably, but this was a terrific experience."]},

Our experience suggests Emirates has grown too big too fast, their A380\u2019s 84+ business & 14 First class seats are sterile, and the interior offers nil glamour.  The on-gound and airport experiences are dumbed down for the volume, and don\u2019t provide the back-up for cabin crews that otherwise tried quite hard.

All juggled on a tray designed to allow said cold cutlery, bread role and any other item not tied down to fall on the floor, this naturally takes place after the traveller in front has pushed his seat (cell) back in order to make it impossible to eat.

The crew were very average, more concerned with discussion amongst themselves than actually looking and speaking directly to the customer. The good, they actually controlled and boarded sections as should be i.e. passengers at the rear boarded first.

Jetstar was quick to resolve this issue for me. I thought the same would go for Vietjet. I was gravely mistaken. They refused to help me provide my middle name, with the reason being that my middle name is too long for them to do anything, and that I should have had my name changed 3 hours before flight time. The first reason sounds absurd because this is happening on a computer, where information is abundant and easy to find. When I had no other choice but to buy another ticket for 5 times the normal price, they refused to use my credit card because their card reader is broken. The representative then resume chatting with her friends while I was facing with the possibility to be left behind in a city where I don\u2019t have relatives, and I don\u2019t have enough cash to stay around. I am greatly disappointed with the service quality and attitudes from this airline."]},

Our flight was at 9:05pm so we left our hotel at 6pm to ensure we would be on time. At 6:55 pm we were checking in. We had no check in luggage, but we had paid for extra weight just incase we needed it. The woman at the Vietjet counter weighed our carry on luggage and asked me to move some clothes around to make one of my carry on\u2019s lighter, no problem. She told us our carry on baggage was fine and we were on our way. We boarded at Gate 11. After the Vietjet staff scanned my boarding pass, I was walking to the plane. Then, a woman comes running at me from behind saying she needs to check my bag. She asks me why there is no tag on my bag. I tell her \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d as I say this, I notice many passengers walking by me with no tags on their carry on luggage. They tell me to move things around. So I put on my winter jacket and move my shoes and clothes into my backpack. The woman questions me, \u201cDid you even check in?\u201d At this point, I\u2019m upset. There is no way to get to the gate without checking in! So yes, obviously I had checked in. She even suggests that I am lying about what the check in staff said. \u201cNo, she did not say that\u201d she tells me, this lady wasn\u2019t even at the check in counter and she\u2019s telling me I\u2019m lying. She tells me my bag must be checked on and it will be VND 350,000. My husband tells her we already paid for extra weight but the woman at the Vietjet check in counter said we were fine. She looked surprised. It is WRITTEN on our itinerary that we paid for extra weight. They are so unprofessional that they are accusing me of lying and so incompetent they can\u2019t even read my itinerary properly. So now, I had removed all these items from the luggage and it made no difference because it was checked in anyways! This woman was so rude. She told me to take out clothes and then made me carry all this extra stuff for no reason when she was making me check it in anyway. I am furious. She was so unprofessional. I was so upset during the flight. I have travelled all over the world and this is the first time I am complaining about an airline. She is not fit to be in a professional field like this. I hope in the future you hire staff who are competent enough to deal with customers properly. Also, I question what kind of discretion your staff is using.  The first lady told me I was fine and the next lady at the boarding counter said I wasn\u2019t. Very important, the woman at the boarding counter did not touch my bag once. She had no idea how much it weighed. She didn\u2019t put it on a scale, she just harassed me from afar. This is ridiculous.  You are an airline. You have an important job and you have hired front line workers who are barely suitable for a job at McDonald\u2019s."]},

I talked to customer service, and the only available flight back to Des Moines was two days later. To get us back sooner, because we had school and work the next day, the representative booked my wife and I on a flight to Moline, IL (UA3660) and told us we could rent a car there (since ours was stuck in Des Moines) and drive to Des Moines to pick it up. He reassured us several times when we clarified that the rental would be refunded by United. He also told us to file the receipt on united.com and that they would refund all the expenses for the drive. We rented a Prius in Moline (the cheapest car they had available). We sent United our claim, which which was denied. United apologized, but would not reimburse us because \u201cUnited does not reimburse those fees.\u201d This was after one of their representatives clearly indicated to us (at least three or four times) just the opposite. As we began to research this issue further we realized this is not a new problem. United Airlines has repeatedly done this to their customers and then left them high and dry (even though their Contract of Carriage allows them to \u201carrange\u201d for ground transportation in the event of a cancellation caused by United). Trying to talk to someone about our claim being denied was exhausting in itself. United has trained their \u201cCustomer Care\u201d representatives to isolate themselves from the rest of the airline\u2019s leadership. It is impossible to talk to anyone about our situation\u2013that is, anyone who actually had any authority to deal with the problem and give us our refund. We tried to reason with their Customer Care for 3 hours, but were told they could not do anything, citing their policy. Even though we only relied on what one of their employees told us, we are the ones that have to foot the $500 bill for renting a car, covering United for cancelling our flight. This is an airline that many college students use as they are often the cheapest option. We wanted to make everyone aware that sometimes it is worth paying the little bit extra to avoid major headaches later. In the end we had to cover the entire $529.45 of the bill.

The agent told us they would send someone to *try* to find our luggage, but that it would take upwards of an hour. So, what choice did we have? None. So we waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, after well over an hour, and well past 10pm (did I mention we were traveling with an infant) we approached the agent, who informed us that they supposedly looked three times, but could not find our luggage.

The first problem was getting a seat although I booked my flight over 2 months ago and I reserved a seat. It took them 20 minutes to fix the problem because they had a computer glitch.  I was the last one to board the plane and there was no more room for my luggage. I was forced to check it in although I didn\u2019t want to.", "Second, there was a storm near Texas and we were delayed about two hours because nobody was allowed to fly out. I understand there are natural disaster out of the airline control. The problem is how these situations are handled. First, one of the flight attendants seemed annoyed by people asking if they can use the restroom and get some water. The other flight attendant was very nice and she tried her best to accommodate people needs. (Thank you to that 1 flight attendant and you deserve a better job than UNITED!) Once we were on the air they started selling food to people about an hour into the flight. I have a gluten free restriction and they had very limited options. I was not planning to eat on the airplane because of my restriction but after hours of waiting I got hungry. I wanted the cheese plate with grapes and chocolate and they sold out!!! That was pretty much my only option so I eat chips which make me sick. Finally we arrived to LAX 2+ hours late and the gate didn\u2019t work. So we waited once again to be let out.", "Finally it was time to go get my luggage, which was taken from me in Texas.  No one told me if I should wait by the door or go to baggage claims once I arrive at LAX. Once i arrived at LAX I tried asking about my luggage but there was big lines to talk to someone. There seemed to be so many people with complaints (Not surprised!). Finally I asked one United flight attendant and with an attitude she told me to obviously go to baggage claim. I told her nobody had explained to me where to get my bag and she was annoyed with my questions. I had flown in other airlines were my luggage was given to me once I exited the plane because it was a carry on.  It was a legitimate question. Once I was in baggage claim they had about 5 different places two pick up luggage. 3 out of the 5 screens was broken. I asked another united employee where I can get my luggage and again with an attitude she said \u201cObviously it\u2019s right there can\u2019t you see it?\u201d. I told her their screens are broken so no I can\u2019t see it.", "Most United Airline employees are rude, disrespectful and not helpful. They seem to hate their job.

It is well worth it to pay a little bit more to fly with another airline, as United, consistently provides less than sub par service. Our last flight was to Aruba, we were flying from Canada, and bought the tickets together for one price, with two connections on the way there and three on the way back. First of all, when I contacted United by phone directly to see about getting better connections, the lady on the phone quoted me airfare that was $200 more than the flight I was looking at. The flight we wanted was directly from the United website. When I told the lady there was a cheaper flight she insisted the one she quoted was the cheapest. I gave her the flight numbers, etc, and she still told me she was quoting me the cheapest fare. What airline doesn\u2019t have access to their own prices from their own website? I would not trust speaking to any agents directly for fare prices. We ended booking through the website, and on our way down, my brand new luggage showed up damaged and absolutely filthy. When I spoke to an agent, they said United would not take a baggage claim because it was only minor damage. My new luggage nows looks very old. In addition, our connections included a layover over night in Chicago. My husband and I paid the $25 each for our luggage and on the way down only had to pay once. On the way back however, after another overnight layover in Chicago, they made us pay twice for our baggage. We paid a $100 dollars for our bags, which to me was unreasonable. The United supervisor I spoke to at the airport, was more than rude, and yelled at us when we complained about having to pay again even when we showed him our receipt. We are well seasoned travellers, so please take may advice and DO NOT give your business to United. Their fares may seem cheap, but you will pay for any little extra along the way. I am surprised they don\u2019t charge for the use of bathrooms on the plane. Send a message, and do not accept this type of service from an airline, We are are the ones that keep them in business.

What should have been a 3 1/2 hour flight from DFW to Newark, an additional connection not included in our original itinerary to Boston, took almost 9 hours\u2013in the air except for a short stop in Cleveland (yes, Cleveland) to refuel. Watching the little plane move around randomly on the map displayed on our backseat TV\u2019s was most interesting. All of this was supposedly due to bad weather. However, the hurricane predicted was nowhere near Houston or Newark, although there were thunderstorms in the Newark area. When we finally got to Newark hundreds of people from a number of flights had missed connections and need to rebook. There were exactly 3 customer service reps available to help us. It took 3 hours to get rebooked and by then it was 2:00 a.m. (By the way, Ticket Counter reps who were approached said they were not allowed to handle rebookings even though they were otherwise idle. About 2 1/2 hours into my wait, a \u201csupervisor\u201d came to our waiting line to tell us that Ticket Counter reps had been authorized to handle rebookings. I wasn\u2019t about to give up my place in line to see if that would actually be the case.) In the meantime United sent me almost 30 emails, many of them contradictory, saying my connection had been rescheduled, had been cancelled due to unavailability of aircraft, had been rescheduled to an earlier time than previously announced, etc. One of the emails informed me that my brother had been rebooked for an early morning flight and that I had been rebooked for an evening flight. That in spite of the fact that I made the reservations for both of us at the same time on the same credit card and we received itinerary with both our names and arrangements on them. This would have meant additional transportation and hotel costs for us so we rebooked both of us for the evening flight and spent the remainder of the night and the following day in the Newark airport. All of this cost us what was to have been a full day (a day and an evening if we had arrived at 5:00 p.m on the previous day as originally scheduled) of sightseeing in Boston. The missed prepaid night of hotel stay and prepaid tickets for events that we missed cost us money on top of the lost time. I understand that United has no control over the weather, but they have cut services so close to the bone that they have no flexibility. No crew available? No aircraft available? No customer service reps available? Don\u2019t they have any redundancy, backups, stand-ins, understudies? Whatever they might call them in the airline industry! I will say that the vast majority of United\u2019s personnel were very courteous, patient, and helpful. It\u2019s company policies that seem to be at fault here.

I had to stay overnight in North Carolina and I missed a very important event that I was scheduled to attend. I finally got to Louisiana the next day. When I was departing from Baton Rouge my flight again was extremely late leaving and while we were still in the air my flight from North Carolina back to Jacksonville Florida departed which resulted in me staying over night again in North Carolina. American Airlines will never get my business again and I will not recommend this airline to anyone. It is terrible."]},

Overall, a good experience to which I have recommended to friends who plan on taking the same trip."]},

No drinks were served and the air-conditioning never worked on the trip to Philly. Miserable. Once again our seats were scattered. Our next flight to DFW was delayed 40 mins in the air because of air traffic making us late for the our DFW to Lubbock flight. We ran to our next flight, where boarding was already underway. No time to get food. So we thought.  Once on the plane, we were delayed 35 mins to fix a seat.  No food offered at all not even for purchase. Cokes were served. Ugg. Worse experience ever."]},

Ground staff and cabin crew were rude, arrogant, impolite, unpleasant, unprofessional and inefficient. They were badly groomed as well. The cabin and seats were so dirty and disgusting. Very old and worn out planes and interior. 99% of the cabin crew were very old and arrogant and I am not sure how they will assist passengers incase of an emergency because they are very old and they weren\u2019t very happy to see any of the passengers. It was clearly shown by their facial expressions, body language, attitude and tone of voice. Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile with me or any other passenger including the passengers who were flying with me. Terrible terrible terrible! Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. Wearing their own ties, colourful hats (for christmas), badly ironed clothes, uncombed hair. They looked like a bunch of homeless people wearing their own clothes which they collected from bins. There was no UNIFORM! Every single one of them were wearing different things. I am Shocked and disgusted by the behaviour and appearance of the cabin crew! The ground staff are equally bad. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off. As a result our plans had to be cancelled and changed. Since none of the passengers were informed or given a reason for the delay few passengers started to ask the cabin crew what was going on. Few minutes later the purser or the CSD who made the announcement (more like barked at the passengers) on the PA to inform the passengers what was going on sounded like \u201cJust suck it up, shut up and wait.

I agree that many planes are old and a bit tatty but they\u2019re getting 20 or so new ones monthly and the new ones are very nice.  I disagree about cabin staff though\u2026..for the most part I find the crews are quite nice, helpful and attentive.  Much more so than most USA carriers, other than Southwest, which is the best.  Most of my flights are from Santiago, Chile to Dallas or Miami and then domestic to the west coast.  If you really want to avoid older planes, less than perfect crew, etc. don\u2019t fly USA carriers at all\u2026..Middle Eastern and Asian carriers are on another planet, especially in the premium class cabins.  That said, I give AA an 8 out of 10 for day-in, day-out service and I\u2019m flying them 50-100K annually.   Plus all the perqs, from free baggage to the best seats at no cost, priority check-in and bag handling, etc. make the odd inconvenience more than worth it.

The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit.

This time the flight was delayed because the \u2018pontoon bridge\u2019 attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac, without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane, when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them. The third flight from Las Vegas to New York was relatively uneventful, tho\u2019 with ungracious and charmless grumpy staff. The food on board was expensive, terrible and tasteless. The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. The original plane had broken down and an even older one had to be fetched from a hanger. It was smaller and extremely tatty, with frayed seats, reading lights that did  not work at all or stayed on all the time, air vents broken, no inflight entertainment, and the rudest staff I have ever met. No staff would tell us what was going on, the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible.

Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop.

Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen, leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Increadibly non interested staff and very very badly kept (no pride in uniforms or general look). Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York, as well an ageing 737-800. As they again charge for checked in bags, all bring oversized bags onboard causing a less than civilized situation where there is NO space for all the bags, thus delays in checking those bags and taking them out of the cabin.
