Although he asked several times, no one could direct him to the American Airlines ticket counter and there are no signs for American Airlines posted anywhere. At first he thought he was in the wrong airport but could see his flight posted on the monitor. He had checked in using the mobile app the day before but was told he had to get boarding passes at the counter. He tried again to use the mobile app and it wouldn\u2019t allow him. He tried to call American\u2019s international help number and there was no answer. We looked online to see if there were directions to their ticket counters and it said they used numbers 90 to 95 so we directed him there and no one was there. He called me panicked about what to do. We were able to get through to American here. At that time I was told that American only has one flight a day from Lisbon back to the States and that American does not have a permanent ticketing counter at the Lisbon Airport and that about one hour before the flight leaves, the one employee who works the ticket counter then leaves the ticket counter to go and board the passengers on the plane. So if you get caught in traffic and get there with an hour to spare, you are still too late. They changed his ticket but I had to pay $400 in change fees. They could not tell me what time a person would appear at the ticket counter but advised that my son should be there at least two hours in advance of the flight. I was also told that their ticket counters were located now at counters 40 through 46 so website was not accurate. The woman I spoke with to change the ticket was unsympathetic and unhelpful. We were told we couldn\u2019t speak to a live person about the problems that we had and were told that we had to write an email. We got a stock response back giving us a number to call and telling us they would get back with us soon. My husband did call the number and the woman gave him a number for airport operations in Lisbon but said she had never been to Lisbon so had no idea what airport looked like. American is like an abusive friend that I keep giving second chances and who keeps messing up. I have had so many issues with them in the past and now this. I do not recommend American Airlines to anyone. Their employees are unhelpful and sullen and do not seem to know anything. They won\u2019t take responsibility for their own mistakes like in this case where they failed to mention in advance that there are no American Airlines signs to direct you in the airport. Avoid them at all costs even if you have to pay a little more, at least you will be assured that you are not going to have your flight canceled and that there\u2019s going to be enough people working to actually run the airlines. American used to be an excellent airlines with great service. The fact that they are now competing with the really low discount airlines with regard to service is just sad. If you are flying out of Portugal with them though and you can\u2019t change your ticket, make sure that you call a day in advance to check on where the ticketing desk is going to be since it appears to change and know that there are no signs."]},

We were leaving Friday evening and planning on returning on Sunday. We were five minutes out from the airport when we received a text letting us know that the flight was canceled. Not because of bad weather but because of maintenance. After a terrible call to your help line where they were rude and informed me they could not do anything for me, I went to get in line at the airport kiosk to speak to someone in person since I was already there and had already spent $75 on my Uber to get there. That is when I discover the true dysfunction. They had no idea what was going on, and the line to speak to anyone took an hour and a half. They had people that were supposed to be working just standing around chatting with each other with a huge line waiting. Each person that came up to the kiosk took around a half hour to get moving. Ive never seen more frustrated people in one place. Not just because of the flight to Charlotte, but because of a number of different flights. The girl next to me was literally in tears because they had lost her reservation back to Greece (which they eventually made right after acting like there was nothing they could do). The person behind me going to Vegas was denied a boarding pass to Vegas because he showed up 59 minutes before to get his boarding pass. One man was sitting down on the kiosk on the phone himself for over an hour trying to get rescheduled himself after you employees gave him the phone because they couldnt handle the probelm, he felt so bad that he went around and apologized to everyone after and certainly was criticizing American Airlines. By the time I finally got to the front of the line, the woman I was dealing with told me she couldn\u2019t get me on another flight that day and couldn\u2019t refund my ticket. I had to go online. Its absurd they don\u2019t give their employees the ability to help customers in real time. I don\u2019t know what CRM they use, but everyone of their employees acts helpless and useless. I called customer service again while at the airport and they said they couldn\u2019t refund me and also pointed me towards the website I finally had to take an Uber back at my own expense again, I didn\u2019t receive a refund for my ticket, I didn\u2019t get reschedule on a flight same night so I had to cancel my trip all together. When I finally get home and try to get a refund on my ticket your site tells me I am not eligible. The fact that I had to call the help line again was absurd. Finally they issued the refund over the phone. Why their customer service rep at the airport couldn\u2019t do that I don\u2019t know. The refund finally came back and obviously didn\u2019t include taxes and your processing fees so I am out another $100 approximately. So when all is said and done they canceled my trip for no reason and could not reschedule me. I am out hundreds of dollars in out of pocket expenses. They wasted hours of my time. And I was not offered any reimbursement or compensation of any type even though I requested it."]},

AA said we could track our bags thru the website. The entire 7hrs we\u2019re at the airport our bags are sitting at the airport we are at. SO said all this to say. WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL FOR PASSENGERS WHO FLIGHTS GET CANCELLED!! Its a very BAD idea to fly their bags to the next destination! And why if the passengers are waiting for a flight that is not leaving until 7hrs later, the AA should have made it there BUSINESS to find our luggage and made sure it was loaded onto the flight they picked for us! Instead of totally giving us the run around about our luggage. Long story short, we did get home around 10:45pm from a flight that should have gotten us home at 2pm.

Ordered Vegetarian for my daughter for return flights as she does not eat meat. On the way over they told her nothing was ordered and were the most rudest people to her about it, they offered her nothing to eat as an alternative and told her go and complain about it!!! So I there called the office and let them know of their staff\u2019s rudeness and that on a 15 hour long haul flight she was starving!! They ensured me that they had it arranged for the return flight and I also upgraded her seat to give her an exit row seeing she is tall to give her more leg room. Yes the meal this time was correct, the staff though were the same rude people, must be a trait for AA. But her seat was broken, Yes Broken, they offered her no where else to move told her once again go complain, she ended up laying on the floor in front of the ext row to try and sleep on the once again 15 hour long haul flight back, so to you AA I would never in my wildest dreams if it was even FREE fly your out of touch airline or ever recommend you to anyone. I have since read so many bad reviews that I wished I had read before making the booking. It was a special trip for my daughters birthday to NYC to see her sister. Your Customer service is the worst she had ever encountered in her life she said, you should maybe put some money into training your staff on if they are having a bad day which seems to be every day do not take it out on your paying customers."]},

But wow American Airlines how bad a service commitment could you show, the plane was actually very modern but the seats were truly terrible- very narrow no where near wide enough for your average person to sit in comfortably, rock hard cushions with almost no leg room and a non-removable armrest set so low that it stuck painfully into my hip for the whole trip. Half way home due to this very poor seating my legs had gone numb and I was suffering a terrible hip pains, I requested help from a hostess who\u2019s answer amazed me when she stated \u201cIts economy deal with it !!\u201d Sadly she was not the only staff member who seemed to think rudeness was an acceptable practice, on our flight there was quite a large number of people from a religious group, it was so obvious that one hostess did not like these poor people and constantly treated them rudely and was very intolerant towards their children. I thought of American Airlines as a flag carrier but can only describe its staff showing as no pride in this at all, they were scruffy with untied hair and a poor dress code quality. One male staff member with his crumpled shirt constantly hanging out and his underarm sweating very obvious- when a fellow passenger suggested he tidy himself up he just aggressively stated \u201c I\u2019m working here\u201d Overall I can only describe this as the worst flight I\u2019ve ever been on, it left both myself and my wife feeling very disappointed and myself still recovering from a very painful hip 2 days later.

However, I am making this exception as I don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else. On my flight to Saint Kitts for study, ai experienced sever weather conditions that lead to a delay in my arrival at my destination. This compliant is one I am sure many people will make with many airlines, but aid was appalled with how they handled this service. First, I understand that weather cannot be avoided and is not the fault of the airline. It is not their fault that they were unable to land at my airport due to the weather conditions or that We flew around in the air for over two hours then stopping for gas at another airport until we finally reached my destination. It\u2019s not their fault that I missed my connecting flight due to the delay. However, it is unreasonable to ask me to pay for a hotel because it is not their policy to compensate for weather related conditions. After spending $1690 on a flight I was forced to spend an additional 210 on a hotel room and arrive late at my destination. When taking my compliant to customer service, I was given a generic answer in which they misspelled my name. I know that 200 bucks isn\u2019t a lot of money for most people. Howeve, I am a student on a budget and ever single dollar is accounted for as well is ever single hour of my time is planned. Not only did they disregard my financial constraints but also my time. I didn\u2019t complain that I had to wait an additional day to get to my destination. I made arrangements with my school to have the issue resolved. I share this experience with any traveler in an emergent situation. Don\u2019t travel with American Airlines if you expect fair treatment in weather related conditions. Don\u2019t expect any reimbursements either."]},

I chose a specific 6:30 to 11 am flight since I was meeting my family in Tampa and we were renting a car together. I received no communication about the flight and decided to call in at 4:30 am to check in. It was at that time that I found out my flight had been cancelled and rescheduled to 10:30 am. Apparently the flight crew needed rest. I called into reservations and was told that my convenient morning flight has been changed to a 10:30 to 8:30 pm flight. The worst part is that the agent made it seem like they were doing me a favor. I told her the new flight didn\u2019t work. I was then downgraded to regular class on an earlier flight with no option of getting refunded. I asked the woman on the phone to double check there was no first class seats available on the 6 am flight. Of course I later came to found out seats were available but the agent was too lazy to check. Everything has to be done online after the fact with no guarantee of resolution. I tried to contact American once i came home but they didn\u2019t even try to fix their complete lack of customer service. There was no real attempt to remedy the situation, the people are not friendly and the savings are not worth the hassle. My return flight went without a glitch.

If you went to another airport there may not have been enough spare crew therefore your flight would be delayed by more than what it was due to mandatory rest periods. Any delay due to weather means the airline is not liable to do anything for the passenger unless they choose to. This is the case with all airlines and unfortunately you would probably have found the same inconvenience and out  of pocket expenses with all the airlines in the US. We know this doesn\u2019t change the fact that you lost precious holiday time which is beyond frustrating but hopefully it helps answer why things happened the way they did."]},

We fly regularly to Honolulu, and the paid upgrade option of old is no longer offered.  Instead of purchasing a coach ticket and paying/using  30,000 miles and $ 350.00 / R/T ticket to upgrade to business class (guaranteed upgrade),  AA now offers you an option to first PURCHASE a COACH ticket, and if the AA gods so deign, they might upgrade you later, if no flyer with greater loyalty status does not bump you in the interim.  Otherwise, you are stuck in coach for the 8.5 ride. What used to be a good airline benefit has turned into flying  nightmare, as there is no recourse to cancel the ticket if there is no upgrade available at flight time.  Since we book months in advance, this has lost its appeal.", "Secondly, the new aircraft are a joke.  The Airbus 321 out of LAX are nothing for Business Class seats.

When I call to find out why and what my options are I get hung up on.  I am gladly paying the $400 extra buck to fly Delta, Non-Stop!  Other than Delta I highly recommend JetBlue whenever possible. Thanks for nothing American Airlines, you almost ruined our family holiday trip!"]},

After three 787 round-trips from Santiago to Dallas I have a few observations.  Overall service the usual American,  good but nowhere near international class.  Now for the 787 itself, just my personal opinion.  To like:  great cabin environment with higher humidity level; all aisle access from b-class seats;  flat beds;  privacy with the seat pods.   Not to like: Aforementioned seat pods which are cramped, claustrophobic, with tight foot space, and worst of all, a console for the seat controls that you continually bump with you elbow, etc.; Seats in pairs one each facing forward and backward and connected so your adjacent pax and you feel each other\u2019s every move;  the great 787 windows partially blocked by said seat console and if facing forward you are too far away from the window anyhow.  Having tried six different seat locations throughout the business cabin,  I\u2019ll opt for window seats 6A/6L.  Bulkhead facing backwards\u2026.more space in general and no feeling anyone moving in a connecting seat.  Close to theTo summarize, a wonderful aircraft that is configured to make it so-so.  For this frequent flyer, I prefer the old 772s."]},

One person handing them out to 300 people. Stood in line for one hour to get a $12 Voucher.  Now sitting on the plane at 5:40 PM. Plane has still not taken off. Apparently they can\u2019t find the copilot. This airline is composed the the biggest bunch of incompetent individuals who do not have ANY sense of urgency it a clue about customer service. I will never take this airline again !!!"]},

Ground staff and cabin crew were rude, arrogant, impolite, unpleasant, unprofessional and inefficient. They were badly groomed as well. The cabin and seats were so dirty and disgusting. Very old and worn out planes and interior. 99% of the cabin crew were very old and arrogant and I am not sure how they will assist passengers incase of an emergency because they are very old and they weren\u2019t very happy to see any of the passengers. It was clearly shown by their facial expressions, body language, attitude and tone of voice. Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile with me or any other passenger including the passengers who were flying with me. Terrible terrible terrible! Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. Wearing their own ties, colourful hats (for christmas), badly ironed clothes, uncombed hair. They looked like a bunch of homeless people wearing their own clothes which they collected from bins. There was no UNIFORM! Every single one of them were wearing different things. I am Shocked and disgusted by the behaviour and appearance of the cabin crew! The ground staff are equally bad. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off. As a result our plans had to be cancelled and changed. Since none of the passengers were informed or given a reason for the delay few passengers started to ask the cabin crew what was going on. Few minutes later the purser or the CSD who made the announcement (more like barked at the passengers) on the PA to inform the passengers what was going on sounded like \u201cJust suck it up, shut up and wait. Don\u2019t bother us\u201d. I do not recommend American Airlines to anyone. Please don\u2019t waste your money. It\u2019s a terrible airline. I will never fly with AA again."]},

But my experiences differ, most likely because I am a lifetime ExecPlat level FF and have been treated very nicely over the years.   As a result I fly up front for the most part but premium economy is fine for me.   I agree that many planes are old and a bit tatty but they\u2019re getting 20 or so new ones monthly and the new ones are very nice.  I disagree about cabin staff though\u2026..for the most part I find the crews are quite nice, helpful and attentive.  Much more so than most USA carriers, other than Southwest, which is the best.  Most of my flights are from Santiago, Chile to Dallas or Miami and then domestic to the west coast.  If you really want to avoid older planes, less than perfect crew, etc. don\u2019t fly USA carriers at all\u2026..Middle Eastern and Asian carriers are on another planet, especially in the premium class cabins.  That said, I give AA an 8 out of 10 for day-in, day-out service and I\u2019m flying them 50-100K annually.   Plus all the perqs, from free baggage to the best seats at no cost, priority check-in and bag handling, etc. make the odd inconvenience more than worth it.   AA is doing a great job and getting better as the new planes are delivered."]},

I have never seen such a disregard for the belongings of others!

As if that wasn\u2019t enough, our belongings inside the damaged suitcases suffered even more severely. I bought eight ceramic bowls in Brazil and only TWO came through intact. Most of the others were not simply cracked, but a collection of tiny pieces. I am not sure how this could have happened because all of the dishes were heavily wrapped with bubble wrap, newspaper and cardboard, placed in the center of the suitcases with thick material buffers on all sides. I was also transporting a doll house inside of a cardboard box and when we picked it up in the baggage claim an entire side was ripped open and the box was soaked!

We were told at the gate that this had been fixed and all was well. Upon our arrival in Brazil, however, the bag could not be located at all. We finally suggested that they look for the bag under the original incorrect label and it turns out that the label was never fixed at all and instead had been sent to Springfield Missouri. It took American two days just to verify that the bag in Missouri was our bag. In the end, it took 5 days to get our bag.

The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit. Offered not so much as a glass of water. The delay meant that the car hire desk we were using was closed at El Paso. The second internal flight was from El Paso to Phoenix. This time the flight was delayed because the \u2018pontoon bridge\u2019 attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac, without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane, when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them.

The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. The original plane had broken down and an even older one had to be fetched from a hanger. It was smaller and extremely tatty, with frayed seats, reading lights that did  not work at all or stayed on all the time, air vents broken, no inflight entertainment, and the rudest staff I have ever met. No staff would tell us what was going on, the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible. Staff were not only surly but extremely rude. In all instances the planes were old, shabby and dirty with worn through upholstery and carpets, defective lavatories, inflight entertainment was broken, reading lights did not work, fresh air vents that would not open, or close and the worst cabin staff I have experienced.

I had platinum status with AA and was travelling transatlantic in business class.  My staff and I spend 7 figures per annum on air travel alone, mostly with AA (at that stage).  On the leg from GCM to MIA, AA did their usual cheapskate move of fuelling to the bare minimum required by the FAA.  Therefore when a spot of lightning was in the vicinity of MIA for only 10 minutes, they had insufficient fuel to circle for that time and headed to Palm Beach.  I checked flightstats.com later and only AA flights had delayed arrivals over that time period! The subsequent delayed arrival of more than 3 hours meant I missed my London connection.  AA begrudgingly gave me a hotel coupon, although only for some flea bitten squalor nearby, with a replacement flight 24 hours later.  No meals covered, no courtesy efforts, and certainly no apologies!  I cannot mention lost baggage in these reviews but suffice it to say that there was a hypothetical passenger that day whose baggage was also lost, never to be found, and reimbursed only to 20% of the losses after 6 months of pain and misery calling and emailing AA constantly.  That hypothetical person now goes out of his way to ensure that the million dollar team travel budget goes to other airlines."]},

I think living in Australia and Asia we are spoilt when it comes to airline service.  This was a 6 hour 15 minute flight from New York to LA.  We had heard that airlines in the USA are lousy and we chose American because it was code shared with Qantas and apparently was the better of a poor bunch.  We thought we did everything right such as booking well in advance and doing online check in.  However when we did the bag drop off our tickets were changed and once we boarded the plane we were no longer sitting together???? To make matters worse when we queried this with the flight attendant we almost got our ears chewed off.  The flight attendants were of a completely different mould to what we are used to on the other side of the world.  They were unfriendly, aggressive, rude, confrontational and unhelpful.  We were unable to get our seats moved.  Both our seats appeared to be broken and not surprising there was no seat back entertainment.  They did have TV\u2019s in the ceiling that were advertising the new on board wifi facility which you pay for but my wife couldn\u2019t hear this message as her earpiece did not work.  For the next 6 hours she was told they would give her another one but they never returned.  The 6 hour flight was absolutely packed, left late out of New York with no entertainment and no quality food.  You could purchase junkfood and snackfood and that was about it.  Very disappointing."]}
