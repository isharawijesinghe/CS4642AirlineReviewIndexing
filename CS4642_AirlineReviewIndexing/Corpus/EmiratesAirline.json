Everything looked fine until I reached Dubai Airport (DXB) before gate. My luggage was weighed by Emirates staff (One cabin bag and a laptop bag) and I was passed through. At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn\u2019t carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn\u2019t check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her immediately Mr. Mohamed (Seemed their Supervisor) came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and started taking to the other side, saying \u201d let me see now, get him deported\u201d. took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said no it is heavier. I opened the bag and showed that there was nothing in the bag except the laptop. but he was acting really rude and was ignoring what I was showing him on ticket documents. he said your other bag is also heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that.I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It was just that he was trying to harass me. He was being extremely rude and said he will make sure that my flight is missed. I was really in trauma while dealing with him as it seemed that he was trying that my flight is missed. As I was in a different country I was really afraid. He was not allowing me to go. It looked like that other emirates staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior. One of the staff member who had weighed my luggage earlier and allowed slowly told me that I could complain online about him. I tried to ask his name but I was told that they couldn\u2019t tell his name. which later I saw on him uniform that his name was Mohammed. Finally I requested him to let me go and I will pay the amount whatever additional they charge. I felt it like a ransom. After a lot of request and paying the amount he allowed me and told the staff to still check in my luggage and didn\u2019t allow in the flight. I was really depressed after this incident and I was scared about my return flight if somehow this person is there again he may put me in trouble again. He shouldn\u2019t have behaved like this. I was surprised why these kind of criminal mentality people are serving in such a service field. I will never take Emirates in future for me and my family, I have also told my friends about this incident and have suggested to not to use Emirates for flights touching Dubai."]},

Only good thing about this airline is comparably cheaper prices. Main problem in the cabin is the seat layout, which is 3-4-3 seat on each row. That means the corridors are thin and the cabin is filled more passengers. It makes you feel claustrophobic. As there are more passengers inside the cabin compared to other airlines, the number of flight attendee is not enough to for providing satisfactory care. One annoying thing about their entertainment system is that you have to watch several commercials before the movies or any other videos. In conclusion i recommend to avoid this airline, pay little more and choose other airlines for better flight experience."]},

You will definitely be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads, and they have those monsters in their back office! what even make it worst, is that I am a regular customer since 2008 & I am on their skyward mileage reward, with a very good/strong history but still wasn\u2019t enough, and they unleashed those complaint team monsters on me \ud83d\ude42 To cut the story short, I bought a ticket with a stopover in dubai, and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more, so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesn\u2019t allow me to stay 1 more day (Max 7 days), and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket! which is nonsense! so I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me! so thats what I call \u201cPirates\u201d attitude, imagine how many people could just pay that penalty without checking or asking for a 1 way ticket! So I submitted a complaint, and simply asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn\u2019t make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there\u2019s no way out! and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! so They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back. (The funny thing, that when you see their ads and the way they sell their services doesn\u2019t reflect any reality, so don\u2019t believe those ads you see, as it doesn\u2019t reflects the whole picture, there is a hidden dark side) So to summarize the story, don\u2019t feel smart when you find a very attractive ticket by emirates as you might end up paying more to go home, plus you will have some disturbing moments when you try to solve this issue with them. Anyway, I only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me, and if you have the time to read the T&C then please do. otherwise you will get bullied by their pirates (complaint department)."]},

I immediately called Emirates to discuss this to see if anything could be done. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats, pay a \u00a3100 cancellation fee or email customer services.

We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite. The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stoney faces \u2013 no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience. Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains haven\u2019t come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband \u2013 are they not taught how to serve customers? We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final \u201cthank you for flying Emirates\u201d sounded matter of fact and so insincere. On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customers\u2019 comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers. Next time we fly to Australia we will use Singapore airlines again \u2013 far superior."]},

During the landing of my flight, I was attacked by 2 British women who throughout the duration of the flight continued to drink excessively. They had clearly drank too much and acted inappropriately for almost the entire flight. Their seats number 65B and 65C.I asked the ladies politely to reduce the noise they were making as I (and many other passengers) were trying to sleep. They immediately reacted aggresively and started to insult me, my religion, my nationality and at one point physically attacked me by hitting me on back of the head.At this stage i went to get a member of the cabin crew who was sitting, as we were still in landing mode. This particular cabin crew handled the situation as well as she could have, reassured me that the passengers will be dealt with and held on completion of landing. Unfortunately this did not happen and the passengers were simply released as if nothing happened at all!Emirates won\u2019t reply or handle the situation after 14-30 days!!! not acceptable!!"]},

Arrived at midnight with 9 hours before my connection and was told that I was not eligible for a hotel.  I was given several highly unlikely reasons why I was not eligible for the hotel which the Emirates website had told me I was eligible for, including that I should flown at a different time of day to avoid the need for a hotel.  I sat in the lounge for 9 hours and when I complained to customer services they denied that I was given any of the excuses that I was given at the time (I had taken the names of the people I had spoken to) and invented some more equally unlikely \u201creasons.\u201d  Emirates customer services never admits any mistake by Emirates.

I fly frequently enough to have reached the Gold level of their horrific frequent flyer scheme, but more on that later.", "Firstly, let\u2019s look at Value For Money.  Emirates are consistently more expensive than their full service competitors, even in the face of falling oil costs. By contrast, the quality of their service has been in steady decline for the last 4 years.  On my first flights between LGW and DXB in Economy on the Boeing 777 and 777-ER, staff were friendly and attentive, multiple drink services were made during each flight and attendant requests were followed up promptly.  On my first Business Class flight from LGW to DXB I was greeted by name with a glass of Champagne on boarding and looked after beautifully throughout the flight.  Compare to my experiences in the last twelve months: in economy the in flight drinks service on medium haul flight has been cut to once per flight (usually about half an hour after the meal has been served) and staff have become surly, impatient and inattentive. The same is true in Business Class, food service has become sloppy and erratic and drink requests frequently go ignored. On a flight from Cape Town to Dubai in June, my wife and I waited nearly two hours for our main courses to be served after we had received our starters. When the hostess eventually did re-appear to clear our starters, she asked if we were ready for dessert. On another flight I had the audacity to ask for a second glass of wine to accompany my (extremely dry) chicken biryani. I waited for 20 minutes before the hostess returned and confiscated my wine glass. I was not even offered a glass of water for the remainder of the flight and the biryani gave me food poisoning.", "Now, let\u2019s look at entertainment. The Emirates ICE (Information, Communication, Entertainment) system is generally pretty good, but is inconsistent across the fleet. In 2011 Emirates started to upgrade the ICE hardware in their 777s, but seem to have abandoned this program.  I don\u2019t know the exact figures but in the 28 flights I have taken since 2011, I have seen the new hardware 3 times. The equipment is unreliable with video and/or audio frequently failing, and in some cases not working at all. Twice while travelling in Business Class I have arrived at my seat to find the ICE system not working (things like this really ought to be checked pre-flight) and I have had to move to an inferior seat. On another occasion, travelling in Economy, my wife had to ask the Purser 5 times to have her ICE screen reset so that it would work properly. This brings me on the Customer Service\u2026", "The Emirates Customer Service scheme is deliberately designed to be as obtuse as possible. Complaints about poor in flight service can no longer be made on board direct to the Purser, instead you are told to send an email to ", "  If you do this, you will hear nothing for a month before finally receiving a reply telling you that issues with in flight service should be reported directly to the purses and that consequently your complaint has been closed. I have had cause to lodge several complaints with Emirates of the last 5 years, for a variety of reasons; poor in flight service, damaged/missing baggage, unexplained flight delays, poor check in procedures etc\u2026 And the outcome is always the same. After making a unilateral decision to close my complaint without my consent, the case is closed and all further correspondence is ignored.  On the one occasion that Emirates did acknowledge that they had done something wrong and offered me compensation, it was on the condition that I sign a document stating that they had not done anything wrong. Essentially,  this is Blackmail.", "Finally, the Skywards frequent scheme. Between us my wife and I have several hundred thousand Skywards miles. This is because whenever we try to spend the miles on Flights or Upgrades we are told that we can\u2019t. Most of the member benefits of Skywards Gold membership were withdrawn earlier this year and the dedicated checkin area for silver members at DXB is frequently left either understaffed and completely unmanned. So, a frequent flyer scheme that promises a lot, but delivers very little, regardless of membership tier.", "All in all, Emirates have stopped trying. When they were a fledgling airline striving for recognition in a global market place they went out of their way to excel. Now that they have achieved the recognition that they wanted, they have given up and are resting in their laurels. Very bad form!!!"]},

What kind of service is this? The attitude and manners of the crew was appalling! For a so-called state of the art airline that everyone keeps on talking positively about, this is not acceptable.

I am pleasant and thankful and this seems to go a long way towards making the experience the best \u2013 I really think it helps to make friends with the cabin staff here \u2013 they appreciate it and respond. Wine and food flows. The menu is very good. The cheese board is beautifully presented and amongst the best on all airlines.

These two window seats, at least, at the front of the second business class sub-cabin, seem to be semi-isolated by a forward projecting centre console between the seats, which houses the entertainment screen for seat 8I (or 8C). It means one has to enter the 8K  (or 8A) seat facing sideways but once in the space it is half way to a first class cell! Yes I liked it. One slight issue is the screen for 8K (or 8A) is on the partition in front of you, so a relatively long way away. I also could not find the control for adjusting the brightness on this screen so had to use the default setting and close the window shades to get best vision.", "\nAll in all though this seat and the flight aboard this magnificent 777 was thoroughly enjoyable.

The crew out of Brisbane is on their last of a six-leg Auckland run, and ours was obviously and overtly tired and de-motivated.  We were expecting a nice experience, and after the limo and efficient Emirates First check-in, there is no glamour whatsoever as all their lounges are crowded, noisy and tired.  And getting off via stairs onto a bus is not a First class experience, nor is zero priority boarding on the return leg.  Our experience suggests Emirates has grown too big too fast, their A380\u2019s 84+ business & 14 First class seats are sterile, and the interior offers nil glamour.  The on-gound and airport experiences are dumbed down for the volume, and don\u2019t provide the back-up for cabin crews that otherwise tried quite hard.  The A380 is too big, too slow, noisy and despite repeated requests/complaints from everyone in the First cabin that it was stuffy, the aircon is just too hot.  No flights suits/jamas in business, No socks and or earplugs in First is not a premium experience and we\u2019re still awaiting one piece of luggage that went astray."]},

All juggled on a tray designed to allow said cold cutlery, bread role and any other item not tied down to fall on the floor, this naturally takes place after the traveller in front has pushed his seat (cell) back in order to make it impossible to eat. Now the crew, Emirates proudly announced they had many language speakers onboard, I am not sure but I think one of the announcements was in English, anyway it may as well all been in Italian as it was totally garbled and unintelligible. The crew were very average, more concerned with discussion amongst themselves than actually looking and speaking directly to the customer. The good, they actually controlled and boarded sections as should be i.e. passengers at the rear boarded first.

We did complain, but there was nothing they could do as the flight was full. We appreciate there is not much they can do once we are onboard and the plane is full, but something should be done prior to boarding when people book to ensure all passengers can be as comfortable as possible, the air-staff would also spend less time dealing with complaints if this was done. If I had a small child I would prefer to be amongst other passengers with children, rather than be embarrassed about all the neighboring passengers complaining about my children. It seemed a bit unfair, four adults who had paid a lot of money for the flight weren\u2019t going to get any peace for 14 hours! Even ear plugs being provided would have offered a bit more quiet. The food was great though and we were able to get the meals we wanted.", "On the flight home from Seattle to Dubai and then to Perth we had dinner and breakfast provided .
