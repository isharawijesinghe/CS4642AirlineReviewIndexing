Qantas is always my first choice or South African Airlines as partner. Would be nice to one day get an upgrade but that is fine. Qantas flight to Cape Town, the food was shocking boiled packet style food as per an old age home. No fruit and little water. Alcohol was easily available. Qantas flight to Australia the air stewards were obnoxious, Danny advising he is not an octopusssssss with many hands and can only do one thing at a time. Please do not hold onto his shirt tails when an elderly lady tapped him whilst he was working the trolley. He then spent the last half hour explaining they were understaffed and had 7 medical emergencies on the plane. Several people commented how rude the staff are. I requested some fruit from Danny, 5 hours into the flight. There is no fruit, he had only the one last apple to offer me. I asked for a banana \u2013 that is it there is no fruit !!! The stewardess advised I should wait till breakfast for the fruit platter. At breakfast Danny advised there was no fruit platter available he will get me vegetarian from 1st class. Whilst clearing service he brought over an opened cold beans and something which I declined. The service is somewhat of a canteen I would rather fly South African Airways with staff who are polite and hopefully the food is prepared in South Africa."]},

Suddenly I had the top of the seat in front taking up the tiny amount of space available. The food was handed to me in a cardboard box. The wine glass was not a wine glass, it was a plastic cup. No complaints about the cabin crew. Good as always. However, Qantas has now joined the ranks of what I imagine are true budget airlines. I had flown Qantas for the past forty years due to them always being well above the budget airlines. Sadly, as Qantas has done away with the quality, almost any other airline will do for my next flight. Sorry, Qantas. You did not need to become so cheap."]},

The cabin crew were unsmiling & unfriendly, seemed to treat the passengers as a necessary evil and delighted in barking orders. JetStar cabin cre compare very favourably to them. The food was appalling; a hot carboard box that smelled evilly and tasted of nothing in particular.

Plane, Airbus A380. We were in row 49 A and B. One row behind the legroom seats. There were 502, approximately, people on board. There is just enough room in the seat space for Qantas not to be charged with some sort of crime of entrapment. When the seat in front is put back, and it was, there is less space than there is for a battery hen. Extricating one\u2019s self from this space on a 14 hour leg to go to the toilet or just get OUT for a while is one of nature\u2019s miracles of escapism. Silver metal tape was used in a couple of the toilets to keep the cowling surrounds under the toilets in place. The toilets had not been cleaned PROPERLY, The food made me think of a Dickensian prison meal. A small, 6\u2033 x 4\u2033 flat plastic dish, of 1\u2033 hight full the cheapest possible stuff. This was the worst flight I have ever experienced. The other 3 legs. 2 going over, both Qantas, were equally horrible, and the first of the return legs, Emirates (code share), seemed disorganised and was not what I was expecting after hearing such good things about it. There must be at least a moral code not to treat people like this. It is actually disgusting. I used to be a Qantas fan but things have taken a definite slide to the bottom. I will not be flying with either of Qantas or Emirates again. My airline of choice from now on will be Singapore."]},

Due to circumstances we wanted to change our flight form Darwin \u2013 Adelaide. Online we got a message \u201ccontact the office\u201d \u2026. So we tried top telephone 131313. We placed three calls: the first one being 37 minutes, the second one being 20 minutes and the third one more than 40 minutes\u2026\u2026 But we never got anybody on the line, only some completely ridiculus ever repeating message. So we purchased some internet time, and wde tried the \u201cchat\u201d. It worked \u2026. But in the end the person could not help because there was a small fee involved, and he could not handle financial transactions. He advised us to contact either an office or by telephone. Contacting an office Friday at 9PM in Alice Springs is certainly not evident. And telephoning \u2026. not possible. So service of Qantas: ZERO, nothing. We solved the problem by booking a flight Alice Springs-Darwin by Virgin Australia. 2. I don\u2019t think anybody of the Management has ever travelled in economy class. The food is simply bad. On our flight Dubai-Melbourne we got as breakfast (after a flight of 11 hours) a small box containing cereals and some milk. Bread ??? Eggs ??? Fruit ?? On the similar flight Adelaide \u2013Dubai, but operated by Emirates, we even got a choice of eggs, we got fruit, we got bread \u2026. On the flight Darwin-Adelaide we got as lunch a small box containing some Asian food. Nothing else \u2026.. Honestly, the smallest roadside shop sells 10 times better food than this. It was simply disgusting \u2026\u2026 Drinks have to be paid for !! On the flight by Virgin Australia we got a decent lunch and free drinks. 3. E-mail messages are simply not replied to, maybe somewhere next year \u2013 who knows. All this makes me sure to nominate QANTAS as the worst airline of the year\u2026.."]},

It is unlikely they (including me) would have eaten anything before boarding the flight. I and most passengers would expect a decent dinner being served and I was extremely disappointed.  The breakfast was served with  a piece of pizza only, can they be more considerate by providing some healthy fruit/salad."]},

First and last time flying Quantas. Experience started with being told I could not sit with my travel companion unless we paid $200 for a row of seats on our flight from Dallas to Sydney. An EXTRA $200. We declined and fortunately some kind passengers traded seats with us. Then I ordered vegan meals and was told they only had vegetarian. For someone with lactose intolerance this was not acceptable. This happened both on Dallas to Sydney and the Sydney to Cairns and Cairns to Melbourne flights. Now on our return flight from Melbourne to LAX I checked our seats this morning and we had a window and a middle. I tend to sleep a lot on flights so window seats work best for the comfort of other passengers who may like to get up a lot. When we got to the airport we got our boarding passes and they moved us to an aisle and middle. We are together but not happy. We would rather sit apart if that meant we had a window seat. I was then told to guarantee my seat I had to have paid an extra $25 per person. What is the point of this?!? Why don\u2019t they just tack this in to the already exorbitant fare? All Quantas does is grub for money and give nothing back in return."]},

And I was seated near the rear, so I assumed they would probably not get to my seat in time. I was wrong on all counts. They began the service 10 mins into the flight as we got to cruising altitude. Somehow, amazingly, the two cabin crew managed to serve everyone \u2013 even me (with a decent wrap and free wine). Then they managed to collect all the rubbish and do a pre-landing check. Despite the stress of serving so many customers in so short a time, they were friendly and efficient throughout. In some ways, this very short flight was a better test than a long-haul international service. Superb ! Wish I could afford to fly Qantas business class internationally!"]},

Usually when he flies from Las Vegas via Los Angeles to Melbourne Australia he always flies with Virgin/Delta. On one occasion he couldn\u2019t get a flight out with them and flew Qantas A380. He was so impressed with the take off and landing, how spacious the seat was and how good the food was that I too wanted to fly out in it. We usually fly with EVA air and Korean Airlines and have found them to be amazing. This time round we  and our 6 weeks old child flew with Qantas. I called and made sure i got a bassinet as I didn\u2019t want to have hold my child for 13++ hours. Since i made the bookings directly with Qantas their partner airline was American Airline, I called the airlines and made sure i was assigned a seat and they said the bassinets are based on first come first serve basis. I explained that i was flying out of Las Vegas and they wouldn\u2019t be at Los Angeles early enough to be assigned that, so they assigned me a bassinet. When we got to the airport, our connecting flight was delayed and the staff only printed one ticket of our international leg. Once we got to the gate, we asked the staff there if they could print out the second ticket. They were happy to but after trying they said, \u201cyou\u2019re definitely booked but i just can\u2019t print the ticket\u201d We would have to wait to get our second ticket once we arrived in LA. The whole time we had seats 52G,H (flying from LA to MEL) assigned to us as we had a newborn and that was the bulkhead. When we got to LA, the staff printed our ticket, whilst running to the bus I realized she had changed our seat to seat 49. Upon arrival at the check in gate I asked is seat 49 a bulkhead seat and the staff said no. The i explained i had called and booked to have the bulkhead and it was confirmed when i checked in at home. After 35 minutes of typing away at the computer, the staff finally said, I\u2019m sorry your flight was delayed so we cancelled your seat. How can they do that???? She continued to say, there was another family with a child that needed it so we gave it to them. You can\u2019t argue with that. I said fine. I still don\u2019t understand how you can cancel someones seat when you know we have already checked in. I requested for a seat with a bassinet and i really didn\u2019t care which part of the plane it was. By this time i was getting upset but still keeping my cool. Upon entering the plane my husband and I glanced to see who was sitting in our seats \u2026 guess what!! there was no family with a child but two elderly couple. Isn\u2019t the bulkhead a priority for parents with infants? We looked at the whole row, the bulkhead on the far right is 3 seater row with 2 people sitting in it with no infant and the one on the left side had the same no infant. the only family with infant was on row 52E,F. 3 bassinets wasted.", "Anyway we are now sitting at the back of the plane, the seats are tight not at all spacious. We explained our distress to the head steward and he was really nice and so was the crew on that flight. He even gave us a fast pass to get out of customs quickly. We were grateful for that, but in the end it didn\u2019t make a difference if we got through customs quickly or slowly as 3 of our 5 bags didn\u2019t make the flight. Im just happy the bag with my child\u2019s formula made it but totally disappointed with the whole flight. Since our child\u2019s capsule didn\u2019t make the flight Qantas was gracious enough to lend us one. Since they didn\u2019t have one at the airport we needed to wait for one to be sent to the airport. That took another 2 hours. What a day we had, we spent half our day just sitting/waiting at the airport. Call me Australian, but I\u2019ll never fly Qantas again. I\u2019ll be flying Virgin/Delta. We were told later that the staff working for Qantas in LA were all contract staff and they should have told the elderly couple to change seats as it wasn\u2019t a full flight."]},

Disappointingly to a Qantas shareholder and Platinum Frequent Flyer, this trip confirmed that Qantas is falling further behind in its competition with other airlines. The short Sydney to Auckland leg was on an Emirates codeshare A380. The Business Class seating and service on this flight was luxurious in comparison with the Qantas flights.  In particular, for the long flight (4hrs 35mins) from Sydney to Perth, Qantas used a recycled Jetstar A330.  There was no in-seat entertainment system.  It was only after discussing it with a steward more than an hour into the flight that we discovered we should have been provided with tiny I-pads for entertainment. These were not in our seat pockets and there was no information advising passengers that they were available. The steward located a couple for us.  While the I-pads provided some entertainment options, they were not very good because of the poor quality earphones provided. I struggled to hear even at full volume on the I-pad. In addition, the controls for seat comfort in the plane did not work. We had to get the steward to manually pull on the leg rest and foot extension to make the seat more comfortable. Apparently this was a common problem on this plane. Considering we paid full Business Class fares, we expected better than this.  As usual, the Qantas stewards go out of their way to improve the flying experience however their efforts are wasted if Qantas management provide a poor quality on-board environment for passengers.  Our recent experience left us feeling \u2018ripped off\u2019 by Qantas. We paid a lot of money for our flights but did not get the quality expected or provdied by other airlines.  Qantas needs to improve quickly if it is to remain a valued and profitable airline particulalrly on the services it provdies to West Australians who feel they are being treated as Cinderella by Qantas.

Add another hour waiting at the service desk only to be told that there was no information on a replacement flight, and that hotel accommodation was on a SHARED basis. As I was travelling alone I did not believe this was acceptable (I also found out later in is against the law in UAE). Given the lack of information and the unacceptable accommodation I was fortunate enough to be able to book a flight DXB to FRA (I was already going to miss my London meeting). After contacting Qantas and providing full details of the incident (at least the customer service agent was sympathetic and was horrified at what had happened) I was eventually told that management had decided that no form of compensation would be offered. After pushing the issue I was eventually given some frequent flyer points (totally inadequate), and advised in an email that Qantas\u2019 only obligation was to get you from departure to destination as per your ticket. Apart from the fact they didn\u2019t, it appears they have not read, or chose to ignore, their own Qantas Charter which clearly outlines what they claim are their responsibilities. A sad day when a once fantastic airline treats its customers so badly (I forgot to mention I have been a Qantas Club member for over 20 years).

The flight crew organised a wheelchair for disembarkation & the Qantas employee was very helpful, taking her through customs & outside the terminal to a taxi rank. Two days later, the same excellent service was provided at both Sydney & Brisbane. Although we have never had a bad experience on a Qantas flight, we are disgusted at the policy of greed displayed by this airline. Later this year we are flying with four airlines, but only Qantas charge a fee for seat reservation at time of booking. They have also increased this fee from $20 last year to $25 this year, an increase of 25%, way above the level of inflation. On contacting their so-called customer help online, they ignored my question of WHY they impose this charge, unlike their competitors, including partner airlines. Not surprisingly, many Australians are choosing other airlines."]},

They have a policy that you can only check in one bag or else you are fined.  I check in two bags (total weight 18kg) and am charged $120 excess baggage. The second bag was a banner I need for a business trip and it weighed only 3kg. I then travel with this luggage all over Asia on Silk Air (budget airline), Malaysian Airlines and Singapore Airlines and none of them charge me excess baggage.  I then fly back to Perth on Qantas and this time am charged a further $153 in excess baggage.  Total of $270 for a 3kg banner that is worth about $100. What a joke of an airline. No wonder the planes are only half full out of Perth.
