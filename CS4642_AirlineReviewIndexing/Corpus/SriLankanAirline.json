I agree with other reviews that they refuse to handle complaints and deny any wrongdoing, choosing to blame the passenger instead. The check in staff at the airport are extremely rude. Although they can appear to be pleasant to foreign tourists, they are hostile to Sri Lankans and other Asians, in my experience and after discussions with many of my friends. On my last flight, I reached the check in desk in the queue one hour and 20 minutes before my flight, but they turned me away saying I was too late. This was despite the fact that they had already weighed my luggage and processed the passengers in front of me and subsequently the passengers behind me. The problem seemed to be that I had a voucher for extra baggage after trading in my Airmiles which the check in staff were not happy about. I had to purchase a new ticket for the following day at great expense and inconvenience. I contacted the customer complaints department in their office who were not interested in this issue or a refund. They falsely claimed that the reason I was denied boarding was due to a heavy suitcase (I transferred some items to another case) and late. However they could not explain if this was the case, why did they weigh my luggage and process others in the queue? I strongly recommend that you do not use Sri Lankan Airlines!!!"]},

I was quite impressed with the ease of check-in, attentiveness of the cabin crew and the tasty meals that were served. The flight attendants wore a smile that made you feel comfortable and at ease to be flying with them. They were attentive and eager to assist with any questions. The aircraft was comfortable and the toilets were clean for duration of the trip. I was especially happy that they were quick to answer when their help was needed and very polite. It has been quite disappointing for me in recent years to see the decline in customer service, when travelling by air, regardless of the cabin flown. My worst experience has been with United and Turkish Airline. The cabin crew act like they are doing you a favor and God forbid you ask for assistance. It was really refreshing to see that some airlines still take a lot of pride in excellent customer service. Keep it up SriLankan Airlines. I hope you can eventually expand your destinations to include North America as I can guarantee you that you have one truly satisfied customer."]},

Customer services didn\u2019t care, neither do their internet team, Sandakumari Ekanayake in particular has made i clear they have no interest in any type of customer service, and has lied directly about the flight details. Colombo airport is one of the most expensive airports I have visited and it was literally 18 USD each for a safe meal. My bottom line is this airline is fine if things go well, but fundamentally if things go wrong you are absolutely screwed, heed my advice unless they are rally cheap book a more reputable airline, my underlining feeling is this is how they treat customers, god only knows how they feel about safety\u2026"]},

They offered fast track channels to passport control at Colombo which worked well. On-line checkin via smart phone also worked well.
