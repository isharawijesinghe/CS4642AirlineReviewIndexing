My connecting flying was delayed and NO ONE even tried helping me find another flight so that i wouldn\u2019t miss my flight to Germany. At the Phoenix airport there were only three people working at an ENTIRE united airlines section which is pathetic considering you\u2019re paying so much money and they still can not hire enough people. On top of it all when i asked one of the ladies to help she said \u201cWe are doing other things right now.\u201d After that i found another airline in order to catch my international flight since no one was willing to help. I made it to my international flight to find out that United cancelled all of my flights including the returning ones. I had to sleep at the airport and got sick and am now waiting for a refund or they will be hearing from an attorney. Don\u2019t waste your money find another airline or you WILL regret it!!!"]},

First the flight attendants on United and their partner Lufthansa are neither friendly nor sympathetic. They act like you are getting in the way of them doing their job. One flight attendant was wearing a toxic amount of cologne. In a closed space like a plane for 8 hours could cause someone with asthma could be life-threatening. This is just inconsiderate. If passengers are tasting her perfume every time she walks by, it\u2019s too much! Second, why doesn\u2019t United know how to accommodate people with special dietary needs like allergies? I\u2019m allergic to dairy but if I order the non- lactose meal I don\u2019t get ant meat. Or worse I get tofu (also cannot eat). This flight I tried another meal-muslim. This time no meat again, but I did get yogurt and butter which I could not eat. All Muslims are not vegetarians. I think United\u2019s solution to customers with food issues is to give everyone a vegetarian meal. I really miss Delta which is an airline that actually serves non- dairy products with the meat and veggies in their non- dairy meal. Unfortunately the US government gave United the European route this year so we are forced to suffer with this inconsiderate and ignorant company."]},

At check in when I was giving my ticket to be scanned to get on the plane the person scanning hassled me about my bag. It had rollers therefore I needed to pay to check it since my ticket did not allow for an overhead carry on. I had no purse. I assured the people both times the bag fit easily under the seat in front of me. No, it must go overhead. I had to tell them I could prove the bag fit easily under the seat in front of me properly of which it did. I watched a woman across the aisle from me try to stuff a backpack under her seat. It barely fit and she had to put her feet under the bag and the headrest on top of it because it wouldn\u2019t fit under the seat. The stewardess didn\u2019t make her put it in the overhead bin.

My flight was supposed to be at 6:55 am from Durham to Des Moines. I planned it this way because I had a job interview at 12:10 pm in Des Moines. They cancelled my flight because it was delayed, they cancelled it instead of just putting me into the delayed flight. So I was put into a flight that left the same day at 2:55 from Durham to Houston and then to Des Moines. Of course, I would miss my job interview. The person who I spoke to did not show any concern and made it obvious that they did not care about the mistake they made. Once at the airport, the flight was delayed which meant that I would arrive at Houston at 6:45 which meant that I would miss the flight from Houston to Des Moines. So they again changed my flight to a later one which put me in Des Moines at 9:00 pm. Again, the operator did not give a rats ass about my situation. This was the first time that I flew and the experience was a horrible one. I will never again fly with this airline because they make their passengers feel like they are unimportant and that our concerns are not important. It is irresponsible in their part to change a passengers flight 3 different times. My whole day was wasted at the airport. I flew from Des Moines to Durham through Delta; I had no problems at all with Delta. When I called the operators for Delta, they were extremely nice and showed that they cared about the passenger unlike United Airline. Why would United Airline cancel my first flight? Was it because someone else paid more for my seat that I had already paid for in advanced? It is absolutely absurd that my flight was changed 3 different times and that each time the operator was a complete jerk. For anyone reading this, I would much rather pay a little more to take Delta than to be treated like dirt and have your flight cancelled multiple times. I also noticed that Delta gave up to 900 dollars to people who volunteered to take another flight or to wait for a different flight when they were overbooked. United Airline just takes you off the flight and basically makes the passenger feel like they are shit out of luck."]},

It\u2019s an airline! Delays and cancellations happen sometimes!! I guess most people that complain about a delay/cancellation are people that don\u2019t travel frequently, are inconvenienced on their one trip a year, and just don\u2019t get it.

In the past, if you\u2019d book a coach seat, you would have a carry-on and a check-in bag included, and if you had an extra bag, it was still ok, no extra fee. You would get a free meal, and the entertainment, although it was on the minimalist side (because technology was not what it is today), was properly working (at least, most of the time). Not anymore. Today, well, where do I start? You book a basic economy seat for a price that is proportionally the same as for an economy flight in the past, AND you have to pay for virtually every single thing on top of that. Only one small item allowed with you on the plane (I guess United figured that you might need a pair of extra underwear and socks if you go to the other side of the country) and they will give you a hard time if you bring a second one (like your camera bag, for instance). Which means that, if you bring a small item with you, along with a luggage of carry-on size, they will ask you to check that luggage in and you will have to pay a $25 fee. If you have an actual check-in luggage on top, that will be considered second check-in luggage, an extra $35. If you book a round trip, that\u2019s already an extra $120 on top of your ticket price. Now, note that I am traveling alone. Imagine being in that situation with a family\u2026 Once you are on the plane, no meal other than the usual boring pretzels and a glass of cheap soda or juice. Prices for extra food/drinks are, of course, comfortably marked-up (food and drinks that are of questionable quality). I\u2019m not even mentioning the ever missing extra blankets despite the still totally dysfunctional temperature management on the plane. Now, moving onto the entertainment part: extraordinarily, United has managed to make YOU, the ticket payer, use your own electronic devices and ear sets, so they can save thousands of dollars by not having to build-in an entertainment system for your plane section. How amazingly smart is that? Instead, they royally connect you to their internal server (of course, if you want real internet, it\u2019s extra. And not cheap) and allow you to download a ridiculously impractical software plug-in that, if you ever finally manage to download and use it, turns out to be the worst piece of garbage I\u2019ve ever used on a plane to watch a movie. I eventually had to stop the experience. You simply can\u2019t deal with a movie that is so chopped up by the constant disconnections from the server that it becomes literally\u2026 unwatchable. By the way, absolutely zero electric or USB plug anywhere around your seat to recharge your devices. Only in selective rows. So, what comes next, United? Paying to use the toilets on the plane? Charging a fee to bring our own device? Another fee to have a reclining seat? Where does it end? How much money can you still manage to save on the back of the customer? Lately, almost every single time I took a United flight, I felt you guys were simply trying to squeeze every dollar out of the customer. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the plane. Yes, you can always say other companies pull their own tricks on customers, that you have expenses, that the market is bad, etc\u2026 I travel all over the world, and many companies that belong to so-called \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d are better than you and treat their customers better than you do. As far as I\u2019m concerned, From now on, I am going to make sure of one thing: to only put my feet on your planes if I have absolutely no other choice."]},

The new Basic Economy fair offered by United appears to be a marketing trick to make their lowest fair seem competitive with other airlines\u2019 basic fares. They are not when you consider the grab for further dollars one experiences at the airport kiosk by attendants stationed there for no other reason than to hold one\u2019s boarding pass hostage until they can very strictly put one through a bag measurement process almost certainly designed to fail most bags. When I made my airline selection for this trip, I had three acceptable airline choices for what seemed to be comparable economy fares, with similar measurement maximums for one\u2019s allowable personal item. I selected United for no other reason than their fare and bag seemed to match the others, but I liked the flight time slightly better. I could have just as easily chosen either of the other two airlines. Had I known the ugliness and embarrassment they would cause me in front of my daughter due to their extortion of further funds at the kiosk, I would certainly have chosen one of the other two. United seems to continually hate and disrespect their customers with policies and procedures designed to humiliate them for needing to fly on a budget due either to family or other commitments. When I left home, I carefully measured both my and my 11 year old daughter\u2019s personal items. Aside from the wheels on her very small child\u2019s size suitcase, both items fit the measurements. I put my purse inside my personal item, such that between the two of us we had exactly two items. The Basic Economy fare does not allow one to check in online before arriving at the airport. One is forced to print one\u2019s boarding pass at the airport kiosk. When one arrives at the kiosk, one cannot complete the boarding pass process without having an attendant approve final printing of the pass by checking the size of the personal item, then scanning his/her badge to unlock the system. The attendant had no problem with our personal items when we left our home airport. We arrived at our destination without incident. United immediately sent me an option to review my leaving flight, but I wanted to wait until we returned home. Returning home from Dallas international airport a few days later was a completely different story. I had to get up in the middle of the night to return our rental car and make a 6am flight. When we arrived at the kiosk, the attendant put us through a rigorous bag measuring process. A zipper on my personal item kept catching on the metal, thus causing a bit of struggle, but I was able to get the bag into the box easily once it loosened. I was VERY tired from having gotten up in the middle of the night, and forgot to put my purse into my personal item. I had to struggle to stuff it in at the last minute. My daughter\u2019s very small suitcase fit exactly, except for the small wheels. Her small suitcase fit under the seat if front with plenty of room to spare on the way to Dallas. Regardless of this fact, the kiosk attendant stated that the measurement requirements had nothing to do with whether or not the item fit under the seat, meaning they were in place solely as a justification to get more money for baggage fees. Once I paid for the bag, the attendant didn\u2019t even finish printing our boarding passes. I had to go back to the kiosk after checking the tiny suitcase to get another attendant to finish printing our passes. The attendants are stationed at the kiosks for no other purpose than to collect more money by scrupulously measuring bags. They are not there for any benefit to the customer whatsoever and could care less about the humiliating them to get more money. Feeling intense despise for United."]},

On the way to San Antonio, my flight was delayed, even after they changed my flight, which meant I didnt get much sleep last night. I decided to forgive and forget. My flight back home was a nightmare. My flights kept getting delayed/cancelled so i asked the agents at the counter to change me to a morning flight, even though it meant I\u2019d miss an important appointment. The agents were rude and unhelpful. I was scheduled for an early morning flight that was then cancelled without any notification. When I went to again change my flight, they rescheduled me to a flight that was known to be delayed and i ended up missing my connection. I ended up getting home almost 24 hours later and United made no effort to rectify the isssue. At the end I was emotionally spent and glad to be home. United (and American) have the worst customer service. I will not be flying with United ever again. The little money you save is NOT worth the hassle."]},

This also means that when you recline your seat as far as you can go, you are barely reclining at all. I can usually sleep on a plane (travelled Melbourne to LA and back in this instance), but I found it impossible to do so on this trip because of the seats. Every time I dropped off my head would fall forward and I would wake myself up. Also, the side bits on the headrest (not sure what they are called???) did not move in enough to support me in the slightest or stop my head from falling forward when I fell asleep. I know passengers get annoyed about people reclining back in the seat in front of them, but this is taking things too far!

I understand when there isnt enough room people have to be left behind but that policy of lowest fare is a cheap out. I have the forethought to book my travels ahead of other passangers and in my opinion that should be rewarded. If it wasnt for my friends i wouldnt have been home to my sick son for another 20 hours."]},

In Denver, I discovered that my flight (UA5163) from Denver to Des Moines had been canceled due to mechanical failures. I talked to customer service, and the only available flight back to Des Moines was two days later. To get us back sooner, because we had school and work the next day, the representative booked my wife and I on a flight to Moline, IL (UA3660) and told us we could rent a car there (since ours was stuck in Des Moines) and drive to Des Moines to pick it up. He reassured us several times when we clarified that the rental would be refunded by United. He also told us to file the receipt on united.com and that they would refund all the expenses for the drive. We rented a Prius in Moline (the cheapest car they had available). We sent United our claim, which which was denied. United apologized, but would not reimburse us because \u201cUnited does not reimburse those fees.\u201d This was after one of their representatives clearly indicated to us (at least three or four times) just the opposite. As we began to research this issue further we realized this is not a new problem. United Airlines has repeatedly done this to their customers and then left them high and dry (even though their Contract of Carriage allows them to \u201carrange\u201d for ground transportation in the event of a cancellation caused by United). Trying to talk to someone about our claim being denied was exhausting in itself. United has trained their \u201cCustomer Care\u201d representatives to isolate themselves from the rest of the airline\u2019s leadership. It is impossible to talk to anyone about our situation\u2013that is, anyone who actually had any authority to deal with the problem and give us our refund. We tried to reason with their Customer Care for 3 hours, but were told they could not do anything, citing their policy. Even though we only relied on what one of their employees told us, we are the ones that have to foot the $500 bill for renting a car, covering United for cancelling our flight. This is an airline that many college students use as they are often the cheapest option. We wanted to make everyone aware that sometimes it is worth paying the little bit extra to avoid major headaches later. In the end we had to cover the entire $529.45 of the bill.

They are not kid friendly and the food options suck. I will contact Sato and to see what we can do to opt out of United."]},

The same was expected of us on our flight home. No apologies, no discounts, nothing was offered for the inconvenience. Fine, things happen, and we decided to roll with it. However, when we asked about hotel accommodations the agent refused to provide us with any information. We explained that we would be traveling with an infant, and would need to know details, and the customer service rep was rude and unhelpful. Fine.

The agent told us they would send someone to *try* to find our luggage, but that it would take upwards of an hour. So, what choice did we have? None. So we waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, after well over an hour, and well past 10pm (did I mention we were traveling with an infant) we approached the agent, who informed us that they supposedly looked three times, but could not find our luggage. Right. So off we went, with no supplies to take care of our child.", "We were directed to an area where we could catch a shuttle to the hotel. We had to wait outside, in the cold, at 11 o\u2019clock at night for a shuttle. The place was a disorganized madhouse (admittedly, the airport\u2019s fault, not United) and people kept rushing the shuttles, leaving us and our baby out in the cold. Finally, we gave up and caught a taxi ourselves, which cost us an astonishing $28 to go less than 2 miles. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk apologized profusely and said that the United agent was supposed to call if someone was traveling with a baby, the elderly, disabilities, etc., but they never do it. If the agent had done her job, they would have sent a shuttle just for us. Additionally, they are supposed to call and request a crib. However, since it was nearly midnight by the time we arrived, there were none available. We would have used our own, but, United lost our luggage.", "Our experience was so horrific that we could not put our young son through that again. So, instead of staying in Newark for our return flight, we decided to rent a car and drive the 3 hours home. We would rather drive 3 hours after a 3 hour flight than deal with the deplorable customer service that United provides. So, we ended up spending an additional $160 to fix a horrible inconvenience caused by United. Our whole experience was beyond unacceptable. We are out nearly $200 because of United\u2019s incompetence. Our son had to sit in the cold, stay up hours past his bedtime, and go without his necessities.

First of all, when I contacted United by phone directly to see about getting better connections, the lady on the phone quoted me airfare that was $200 more than the flight I was looking at. The flight we wanted was directly from the United website. When I told the lady there was a cheaper flight she insisted the one she quoted was the cheapest.

Watching the little plane move around randomly on the map displayed on our backseat TV\u2019s was most interesting. All of this was supposedly due to bad weather. However, the hurricane predicted was nowhere near Houston or Newark, although there were thunderstorms in the Newark area. When we finally got to Newark hundreds of people from a number of flights had missed connections and need to rebook. There were exactly 3 customer service reps available to help us. It took 3 hours to get rebooked and by then it was 2:00 a.m. (By the way, Ticket Counter reps who were approached said they were not allowed to handle rebookings even though they were otherwise idle. About 2 1/2 hours into my wait, a \u201csupervisor\u201d came to our waiting line to tell us that Ticket Counter reps had been authorized to handle rebookings. I wasn\u2019t about to give up my place in line to see if that would actually be the case.) In the meantime United sent me almost 30 emails, many of them contradictory, saying my connection had been rescheduled, had been cancelled due to unavailability of aircraft, had been rescheduled to an earlier time than previously announced, etc. One of the emails informed me that my brother had been rebooked for an early morning flight and that I had been rebooked for an evening flight. That in spite of the fact that I made the reservations for both of us at the same time on the same credit card and we received itinerary with both our names and arrangements on them. This would have meant additional transportation and hotel costs for us so we rebooked both of us for the evening flight and spent the remainder of the night and the following day in the Newark airport. All of this cost us what was to have been a full day (a day and an evening if we had arrived at 5:00 p.m on the previous day as originally scheduled) of sightseeing in Boston. The missed prepaid night of hotel stay and prepaid tickets for events that we missed cost us money on top of the lost time. I understand that United has no control over the weather, but they have cut services so close to the bone that they have no flexibility. No crew available? No aircraft available? No customer service reps available? Don\u2019t they have any redundancy, backups, stand-ins, understudies? Whatever they might call them in the airline industry!

We picked this specific itinerary to be sure we would be flying on a twin isle aircraft.  We were on a Boeing 767-400ER.  This flight was more money thank flying via LAX or SFO but it allowed us to get a full sleep on the return trip home.  Also, the thought of spending 4-6 hours in a 737 makes my stomach churn.  The plane was spotless inside and out.  Comfortable seats as well.  We had 2 isle and 2 windows as we were traveling with kids and they insisted on both having window seats.  I do find it irritating that food is still an extra charge for food for such a long and expensive flight but at least the offerings were reasonably priced and tasted good.  The entertainment system was ok.  Not up to par compared to a recent Swiss international flight we took, but not bad either.  It kept the kids amused long enough.  Overall, a good experience to which I have recommended to friends who plan on taking the same trip."]},

To the credit of the United team member, she did eventually decide to help me check in my luggage as I was travelling on to AUS with Qantas, but it was touch and go for a while.  The cabin crew on the other hand, are very helpful and nice.  I travelled united economy NYC-SF and they were as nice in Economy as they were in First class from SF."]},

No aircraft swap. On the ORD-SIN 747, 12 seats in FC we selected 1A, 2A seven months before the flight. As with all three flights we were the first to book so the cabin was wide open. The seats were changed six times and eventually wound up in the last seats I would have selected. On our next flight in March 2014 our seats were changed twice so far. Calls to UAL are no help at all. There are only a few seats up front, why can\u2019t United get it right for the people who pay a lot for their terrible service???

Although a very short flight, the service from the flight attendants was incredibly poor. Walking on the plane, we were faced with a male flight attendant at the opening door who had a large Starbucks he was drinking. He also didn\u2019t greet any of the passengers on entry. He then proceeded to walk around the cabin doing pre takeoff checks with his Starbucks. I actually found this behaviour quite unsettling as trusting a crew that needs to drink coffee in front of passengers does not give one a lot of trust in their ability to react to emergency situtations if required. Further, when people asked questions, the flight attendant crew acted as though this were an inconvenience to them. I found this extremely unprofessional behaviour by the flight attendant crew. Residing in Australia, if I ever take a domestic flight in the USA, think I will stick with American Airlines."]}
