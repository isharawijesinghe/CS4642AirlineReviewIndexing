People standing during landing, even walking to my window and blocking my view to see out. Captain even came on the intercom and shouted blast off just before take off. Avoid at all costs."]},

We got an email 2 times a few days before departure to tell us about the changes so make sure you check your email regularly for updates. They are very strict with carry on weight so make sure you are only bringing a carry on for 7KG total for 2 items. They will add everything together at the aiport. We ended paying around $35 CAD in fine as my carry one suitcase and back pack was over 7KG total. You can only have 1 check in suitcase per person at 40-50lbs max so make sure to pack light and not too much. The seats were not that comfy as the cushion thin so best to only use VietJet for short flights within Vietnam. I would avoid booking them for long flights unless you don\u2019t mind seats with thin cushions. Overall they are good value for what you are paying. I would use them again if they are the cheapest & for short domestic flights only."]},

Our flight was at 9:05pm so we left our hotel at 6pm to ensure we would be on time. At 6:55 pm we were checking in. We had no check in luggage, but we had paid for extra weight just incase we needed it. The woman at the Vietjet counter weighed our carry on luggage and asked me to move some clothes around to make one of my carry on\u2019s lighter, no problem. She told us our carry on baggage was fine and we were on our way. We boarded at Gate 11. After the Vietjet staff scanned my boarding pass, I was walking to the plane. Then, a woman comes running at me from behind saying she needs to check my bag. She asks me why there is no tag on my bag. I tell her \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d as I say this, I notice many passengers walking by me with no tags on their carry on luggage. They tell me to move things around. So I put on my winter jacket and move my shoes and clothes into my backpack. The woman questions me, \u201cDid you even check in?\u201d At this point, I\u2019m upset. There is no way to get to the gate without checking in! So yes, obviously I had checked in. She even suggests that I am lying about what the check in staff said. \u201cNo, she did not say that\u201d she tells me, this lady wasn\u2019t even at the check in counter and she\u2019s telling me I\u2019m lying. She tells me my bag must be checked on and it will be VND 350,000. My husband tells her we already paid for extra weight but the woman at the Vietjet check in counter said we were fine. She looked surprised. It is WRITTEN on our itinerary that we paid for extra weight. They are so unprofessional that they are accusing me of lying and so incompetent they can\u2019t even read my itinerary properly. So now, I had removed all these items from the luggage and it made no difference because it was checked in anyways! This woman was so rude. She told me to take out clothes and then made me carry all this extra stuff for no reason when she was making me check it in anyway. I am furious. She was so unprofessional. I was so upset during the flight. I have travelled all over the world and this is the first time I am complaining about an airline. She is not fit to be in a professional field like this. I hope in the future you hire staff who are competent enough to deal with customers properly. Also, I question what kind of discretion your staff is using.  The first lady told me I was fine and the next lady at the boarding counter said I wasn\u2019t. Very important, the woman at the boarding counter did not touch my bag once. She had no idea how much it weighed. She didn\u2019t put it on a scale, she just harassed me from afar. This is ridiculous.  You are an airline. You have an important job and you have hired front line workers who are barely suitable for a job at McDonald\u2019s."]},
